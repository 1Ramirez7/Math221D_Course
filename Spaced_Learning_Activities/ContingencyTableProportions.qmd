# Introduction

This dataset has information about every Olympic participant and medal awards for all the Summer and Winter Olympics from 1896-2016.  


```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(rio)
library(car)

olympics <- read_csv('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Course/raw/refs/heads/main/Data/Olympics.csv')

glimpse(olympics)

```


Create a clean dataset for Summer Olympics that includes:  

   1. Summer Olympics (`Season`)
   2. Keeps only the columns NOC and Medal
   3. Drops the missing values (`drop_na()`)

```{r}

summer <- olympics %>%
  

```


Create a table that has the proportion of medals won by NOC (National Olympic Committees)


```{r}


```
