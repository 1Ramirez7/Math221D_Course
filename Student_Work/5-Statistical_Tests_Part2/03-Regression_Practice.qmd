# Introduction

In this assignment, you will practice regression analysis including:

  * Plotting bivariate data with a regression line
  * Calculating and interpreting the correlation coefficient, r
  * Fitting a linear regression analysis
  * Verifying if a linear model is model is adequate:
    * Checking for linearity (scatterplot)
    * Checking for constant variance (`plot(lm_output, which=1)`)
    * Checking for normality of residuals (`qqPlot(lm_output$residuals)`)

# Car Prices and Mileage

You are interested in purchasing an all wheel drive Acura MDX for those slick Rexburg winters.  You found what you think is a good deal for on a low-mileage 2020 model but you'd like to be sure.  You go on Autotrader.com and randomly select 23 Acura MDX's and collect Price and Mileage information.

Load the data and use R to answer the questions below.  

```{r}

cars <- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/acuraMDX_price_vs_mileage.csv')

```

Before you begin:

__What is the response/dependent variable?__


__What is the explanatory variable__


__What do you think is the nature of the relationship between the two?__


__How strong do you think the relationship is?__



## Plot the Data and calculate r

```{r}


```


__Does the relationship look linear?__


__What is the correlation coefficient, r?__


__What does this r show?__


## Fit a Linear Regression Model

```{r}

#lm_output <- lm()

```

Add the regression line to your chart:

```{r}
# Sometimes you have to run the whole chunk with plot() and the abline() together:

#plot()
#abline(lm_output$coefficients)

```

__What is the slope of the regression line, and what does it mean?__


__What is the intercept and what does it mean?__


__What is your p-value?__


__What is your conclusion?__


__What is the confidence interval for the slope?__

```{r}

```

Interpret the confidence interval.

## Check Model Requirements

Check the normality of the residuals:

```{r}

```

Check for constant variance (Residual by Predicted plot):

```{r}
#plot(lm_output, which = 1)
```


Lastly, the car you're interested in buying has around 100,000 miles and costs $11,200.  Could this be considered a good deal?  Why?

# Manatee Deaths and Motorboat Registrations in Florida

Florida is a fabulous place for experiencing wildlife and recreation.  Unfortunately, sometimes those two activities conflict.

Researchers collected over 30 years of data about water craft registrations (motor and non-motor boats) and manatee deaths.  The goal of the research is to evaluate the relationship between boat registrations and manatee deaths.

Before you begin:

__What is the response/dependent variable?__

__What is the explanatory variable__

__What do you think is the nature of the relationship between the two?__

__How strong do you think the relationship is?__


Load the data:
```{r}
manatees <- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/manatees.csv')
```

## Plot the Data and calculate r

```{r}


```

__Does the relationship look linear?__

__What is the correlation coefficient, r?__

__What does this r show?__


## Fit a Linear Regression Model

```{r}


```

Add the regression line to your chart:

```{r}
# Sometimes you have to do the plot() and the abline() in one chunk and run the whole thing:


```

__What is the slope of the regression line, and what does it mean?__


__What is the intercept and what does it mean?__


__What is your p-value?__


__What is your conclusion?__


__What is the confidence interval for the slope?__

```{r}

```

__Interpret the confidence interval:__

## Check Model Requirements

Check the normality of the residuals:

```{r}

```

Check for constant variance (Residual by Predicted plot):

```{r}


```

# MCAT Score and GPA

The MCAT is an entrance exam for medical schools.  It seems likely that there is a relationship between your undergraduate GPA and how well you do on the MCAT.  

GPA and MCAT score data were collected on 55 prospective medical students.  

Before you begin:

__What is the response/dependent variable?__

__What is the explanatory variable__

__What do you think is the nature of the relationship between the two?__

__How strong do you think the relationship is?__


Load the data:
```{r}
mcat <- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/mcat_gpa.csv')
```

## Plot the Data and calculate r

```{r}
