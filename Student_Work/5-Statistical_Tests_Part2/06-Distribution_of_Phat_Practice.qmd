# Instructions

Complete the following questions about the sampling distibution of $\hat{p}$.  When completed, Render the `qmd` file and submit the `html`.

# Questions

__Question__: When can we use the normal distribution to approximate the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$?  
__Answer__:  

__Question__:  What is the mean of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$?  
__Answer__:  

__Question__:  What is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$?  
__Answer__:  


Suppose the true *population* proportion, $p$, of people who support a candidate for office is 52\%.  We would like to learn something about a *sample* proportion, $\hat{p}$, with a sample size $n=1000$ suggesting that the candidate will lose the election ($\hat{p}<0.50$).

Use the following R code to answer the questions below:  


```{r}
phat <- 
p <-
n <- 

sigma_phat <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)  

z <- (phat-p) / sigma_phat

# Left Tail:
pnorm()

# Right tail
1-pnorm()

```

__Question__:  What is the $z$-score associated with $\hat{p}<0.5$?  
__Answer__:


__Question__:  What is the standard deviation of $\hat{p}$?  
__Answer__:  


__Question__:  What is the probability of a sample of size $n=1000$ suggesting that the candidate will lose even if the true population support, $p=0.52$?  
__Answer__:
