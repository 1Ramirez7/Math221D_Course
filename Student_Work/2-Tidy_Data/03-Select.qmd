# Selecting Columns

Consider the High School survey data with 60 columns and 312 respondents.  


```{r}

# Load libraries and data

library(rio)
library(mosaic)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)

survey <- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/HighSchoolSeniors_subset.csv') %>% tibble()

```

It is likely that we are not interested in analyzing every column in this dataset.  Many may even be useless.  We can use the tidyverse function, `select()` to create a subset of the columns that we are primarily interested in.  

Recall that we can "pipe" the raw data into tidy functions using `%>%`.  Suppose we want to see if there are differences in reaction times (`Reaction_time`) for left-handed and right-handed students.  We could create a more manageable dataset with only the columns of interest:

```{r}

survey %>%
  select(Handed, Reaction_time)

```

```{r}
clean <- survey %>%
  filter(Handed != "Ambidextrous",
         Reaction_time < 1) %>%
  select(Handed, Reaction_time)

boxplot(clean$Reaction_time ~ clean$Handed, col = c(2,3), ylab = "Reaction Times", xlab="", main = "Distribution of Reaction times for \n Left and Right-hand Dominance")

```

Which hand dominance appears to have quicker reaction times?
