# Introduction

In this activity, you will execute statistical hypothesis tests and generate confidence intervals for each of the Big 5 personality traits using data collected from a random sample of Brother Cannon's Math 221 students.  

__Question__:  What is the population of this analysis?  
__Answer__:  

For each personality trait, include:

1. A statement of the null and alternative hypotheses and why you chose the alternative you did.
1. Choose alpha, $\alpha = $
1. Check that you can trust the normality of the mean (`n > 30` or `qqPlot(respons_variable)`)
1. Run the one-sample t-test and state your conclusion (technical and contextual explanation)
1. Calculate a $1-\alpha$ level confidence interval and describe in words what it means in context of the research question

Recall that we can use `favstats()` to get summary statistics, `boxplot()` and `histogram()` to get visualizations, and the `t.test()` function to get hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.  **Be sure to label your plots' axes and include a title.**

```


# Extroversion

State your null and alternative hypotheses:  

$$H_o:  \mu = 50$$  
$$H_a:  \mu > 50$$  

$$\alpha = 0.025 $$  
1. Create a table of summary statistics:  

```{r}
# Extroversion

favstats(big5$Extroversion) %>% knitr::kable()
```

2. Create a histogram of Extroversion:  

```{r}
### I'm making a single variable called "extrov" that drops the missing values.  You can do the same thing with the other traits to make analysis a little easier
extrov <- na.omit(big5$Extroversion) 

histogram(extrov, xlab = "Extroversion", main = "Histogram of Extroversion Percentiles")
```

3. Perform the one-sample t.test:  

```{r}
# For Hypothesis Test:
t.test(extrov, mu = 50, alternative = "greater")
```

4. Explain your conclusion:  

Technical:  Because the p-value is less than $\alpha$, I reject the null hypothesis.  

Contextual:  I have sufficient evidence to suggest that Brother Cannon's students are, on average, more Extroverted than the general population.  

5. Create a Confidence Interval for the average extroversion of Brother Cannon's students:  

```{r}
# For a Confidence Interval:
t.test(extrov, conf.level = 1-.025)$conf.int
```

6. Explain your confidence interval:  

I am 97.5% confident that the true average extroversion of Brother Cannon's students is somewhere between the 54.62 and 59.34 percentiles.  

# Agreeableness

State your null and alternative hypotheses.  For example, do you think Brother Cannon's students are more, less, or just different than the general population?  

$$H_o:  \mu  $$  
$$H_a:  \mu $$  

$$\alpha =  $$    
1. Create a table of summary statistics for Agreeableness:  

```{r}

```

2. Create a histogram of Agreeableness:  

```{r}

```

3. Perform the one-sample t.test:  

```{r}

```

4. Explain your conclusion:  

Technical:  

Contextual:  

5. Create a Confidence Interval for the average agreeableness of Brother Cannon's students:  

```{r}
# For a Confidence Interval:
t.test()$conf.int
```

6. Explain your confidence interval:  



# Openness
State your null and alternative hypotheses:  

$$H_o:  \mu $$  
$$H_a:  \mu $$  

$$\alpha = $$  

1. Create a table of summary statistics for Openness:  

```{r}

```

2. Create a histogram of Openness:  

```{r}

```

3. Perform the one-sample t.test:  

```{r}

```

4. Explain your conclusion:  

Technical:  

Contextual:  

5. Create a Confidence Interval for the average openness of Brother Cannon's students:  

```{r}
# For a Confidence Interval:
t.test()$conf.int
```

6. Explain your confidence interval:  



# Neuroticism

State your null and alternative hypotheses:  

$$H_o:  \mu $$  
$$H_a:  \mu $$  

$$\alpha =  $$  
1. Create a table of summary statistics for Neuroticism:  

```{r}

```

2. Create a histogram of Neuroticism:  

```{r}

```

3. Perform the one-sample t.test:  

```{r}

```

4. Explain your conclusion:  

Technical:  

Contextual:  

5. Create a Confidence Interval for the average neuroticism of Brother Cannon's students:  

```{r}
# For a Confidence Interval:
t.test()$conf.int
```

6. Explain your confidence interval:  



# Conscientiousness

State your null and alternative hypotheses:  

$$H_o:  \mu $$  
$$H_a:  \mu $$  

$$\alpha = $$  
1. Create a table of summary statistics:  

```{r}

```

2. Create a histogram of Conscientiousness:  

```{r}

```

3. Perform the one-sample t.test:  

```{r}
