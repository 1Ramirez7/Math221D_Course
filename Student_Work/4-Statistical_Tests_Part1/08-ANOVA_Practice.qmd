# Life Expectancy of Female Authors

## Introduction

You are curious to compare life expectancy between female poets, novelists, and non-fiction writers.  

You take  a sample of female authors from each of the three groups to test if the average age at death is different between any of the three types of authors using a level of significance of, $\alpha = 0.05$.

## Load the Data and Libraries


```{r}
library(rio)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(car)

womenpoet <- rio::import("https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_M221_Book/Data/womenpoet.xls")

```

## Explore the Data

Create a side-by-side boxplot of the age at death of each of the different author styles.

Modify the colors of each of the boxes for each group.

```{r}

```


Create a summary statistics table for age at death for each author type:

```{r}


```

List the mean and standard deviations of age at death for:

1. Novelists:
2. Poets: 
3. Non-fiction: 

## Perform the Appropriate Analysis

State your null and alternative hypotheses:


Perform an Analysis of Variance test including checking for the appropriateness of our analysis.

```{r}

```

__Question__:  What is the test statistic?
__Answer__:  


__Question__:  What are the degrees of freedom for your analysis?
  a. Numerator (between Groups) Degrees of Freedom
  b. Denominator (within groups) Degrees of Freedom
__Answer__:  


__Question__:  What is the P-value?
__Answer__:  


__Question__:  Do you reject the null hypothesis?  Why?
__Answer__:  


__Question__:  State your conclusion in context of the problem.
__Answer__:  


__Question__:  Can we trust the p-value?
  a. Check for equal standard deviation (is the ratio of the largest SD / smallest SD greater than 2?)
  b. Check Normality of the residuals (`qqPlot()`)
__Answer__:  


# Testing Mosquitos

## Introduction

A study was conducted to determine if different types of material can reduce the amount of mosquito human contact.  The researchers evaluated five different types of patches 1=Odomos, 2=Deltamethrin, 3=Cyfluthrin, 4=D+O, 5=C+O.  

The amount of mosquito human contact was measured to assess any differences between the five different types of material. Use a level of significance of 0.05.

## Load the Data

```{r}

MosquitoPatch <- rio::import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdcromar/Math221D/main/MosquitoPatch.csv") %>% mutate(Treatment = factor(Treatment))

```


## Review the Data

Create a side-by-side boxplot for human contact for each of the treatment groups.

Add a title and change the colors of the boxes.  

```{r}

```

Create a summary statistics table for human contact for each of the treatment groups:

```{r}

```

__Question__:  What do you observe?
__Answer__:  

__Question__:  What is the maximum standard deviation?
__Answer__:  

__Question__:  What is the minimum standard deviation?
__Answer__:  


## Perform the Appropriate Analysis

State your null and alternative hypotheses:

Perform an Analysis of Variance test including checking for the appropriateness of our analysis.

```{r}

```

__Question__:  What is the test statistic (F-value)?
__Answer__:  

__Question__:  What are the degrees of freedom for your analysis?

  a. Numerator (between Groups) Degrees of Freedom
  b. Denominator (within groups) Degrees of Freedom
__Answer__:  
  
__Question__:  What is the P-value?
__Answer__:  

__Question__:  Do you reject the null hypothesis?  Why?
__Answer__:  

__Question__:  State your conclusion in context of the problem.
__Answer__:  

__Question__:  Can we trust the p-value?
  a. Check for equal standard deviation (is the ratio of the largest SD / smallest SD greater than 2?)
  b. Check Normality of the residuals (`qqPlot()`)
__Answer__:
