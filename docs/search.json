The general types of assessments used to measure these outcomes may include selected response tests such as multiple-choice, true-false, matching, and fill-in-the-blank questions. You may also be asked to complete essays or other writing assignments. At times, the instructor may assess your performance of a skill, or the instructor may assess products you create using particular skills. In addition, the instructor may engage in personal communication with you to determine how well you understand the course content.\n\n\n\nKeys to Success\n\nFive Principles of the Learning Model\nYou will experience much deeper learning if you follow the Five Principles of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model\n\nExercise Faith: Exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as a principle of action and power.\nLearn by the Holy Ghost: Understand that true teaching is done by and with the Holy Ghost.\nLay Hold on the Word of God: Lay hold of the word of God.\nAct for Themselves: Act for yourself and accept responsibility for learning and teaching.\nLove, Serve, and Teach One Another: Love, serve, and teach other students in your classes.\n\n\n\nThree Process Steps of the Learning Model\nYou will learn more in less time if you follow the Three Process Steps of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model\n\nPrepare: This involves (a) spiritual preparation, (b) individual preparation, and (c) group preparation.\nTeach One Another: You should (a) be on time, (b) pray together, and (c) actively engage with other students.\nPonder/Prove: You should (a) ponder what you have learned, (b) record your learning, and (c) pursue unanswered questions and discuss what you learn with others.\n\nIf you feel confused or have questions about anything in the lesson, take immediate action (Exercise Faith; Act for Themselves) and talk with your classmates, the teaching assistant, or the instructor (Love, Serve, and Teach One Another).\nTeach One Another\nAt BYU-Idaho, an “A” student will demonstrate “diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving other students” (BYU-Idaho Catalog). In this class, you will have the opportunity to work with other students.\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:106 states, “And if any man among you be strong in the Spirit, let him take with him him that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that he may become strong also.” In the spirit of this revelation, you will have the opportunity to help others in the class when you have developed an understanding of a principle. Likewise, you will be able to receive help from others (peers, tutors, TA, and your instructor) when you are still working to understand concepts.\nIn a spirit of love and service, please reach out to others. You are not graded on a curve. If someone else does well, it does not affect you adversely. Research has shown that students who help other students to understand the material gain a much deeper grasp on the concepts of the course. Please take opportunities to help your peers succeed."

If the general order of the lessons doesn’t make sense at first, don’t worry. It will all come together in the end, and you’ll see the reasoning behind why the lessons have been presented in this particular order.\nYour main goal as a student will be to complete all of the learning activities within each lesson by their due dates every week. These activities follow a consistent weekly schedule, and it will be up to you to make sure that you keep on pace with all your assignments. These weekly activities may include the following:\n\nReading assigned texts or viewing presentations.\nTaking quizzes.\nParticipating in group discussions and assignments with other class members.\nWriting papers and/or developing presentations.\nParticipating in meetings with the instructor, teaching assistants, and other students.\n\nFor many of these activities, the due dates will fall on the same time each week. This will make it easier for you to plan out your weekly study schedule. However, there may be a need to make adjustments to the schedule from time to time. If in doubt, refer to the due dates your instructor has posted in I-learn.\nYou should create a study schedule that will keep you on pace throughout the semester. This is a rigorous course with a lot of subject matter to cover, and it can be extremely difficult to recover if you fall too far behind in your work. So, please make every effort to study on a regular basis and get your work turned in on time.\nThe lessons in this course have a similar structure and contain similar basic elements. A typical week consists of two lessons. Each lesson will consist of a reading assignment, a reading/preparation quiz, and a homework quiz.\nThe structure of this course fully integrates the BYU-Idaho Learning model with a mixture of preparation activities, teach-one-another activities, and ponder-and-prove activities."

    "text": "Introduction\nStatistics are used in every aspect of society. Every statistical analysis follows a pattern we will call the Statistical Process. This process will be introduced in this lesson and will be used throughout the course.\n\n\nThe Statistical Process and Daniel’s Experiment\n\n\n\nStained-glass depiction of Daniel’s deliverance from the lions’ den. Found in the old Dominican priory church at Hawkesyard in Staffordshire, England. (Photo credit: Fr Lawrence Lew, O.P. Used by permission.)\n\n\n\nThe Old Testament prophet Daniel planned one of the earliest recorded scientific research studies. We will use his example to illustrate the following five steps of The Statistical Process.\nThe following icons can help you remember these steps. Notice that each icon has a letter and an image to help you remember the five steps of the Statistical Process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign the Study\n\n\n\nCollect the Data\n\n\n\nDescribe the Data\n\n\n\nMake Inference\n\n\n\nTake Action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Design the Study\n\nAn important step in scientific inquiry or problem solving can be to state a research question such as:\n\nWill internet advertising increase a company’s revenue?\nDoes expressing gratitude increase a person’s satisfaction with life in general?\nDoes a newly developed vaccine prevent the spread of disease?\n\nResearchers also investigate the background of the situation. What have other people discovered about this situation? How can we find the answer to the research question? What do we need to do? What is the population (or total collection of all individuals) under consideration? What kind of data need to be collected?\nBefore collecting data, researchers make a hypothesis, or an educated guess about the outcome of their research. A hypothesis is a statement such as the following:\n\nUsing internet advertising will increase the company’s sales revenue.\nPeople who express gratitude will be more satisfied with life than those who do not.\nA newly-developed vaccine is effective at preventing tuberculosis.\n\n\n\nDaniel’s Experiment\nAfter taking Israel captive, Babylon’s King Nebuchadnezzar asked his chief officer to bring Israelite children who were well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science to stand in the king’s palaces (Daniel 1:4). To aid their preparation, Nebuchadnezzar planned to feed them his meat and wine for three years (Daniel 1:5).\nDaniel did not want to defile himself by partaking of the king’s meat and wine. He asked permission to eat pulse[^1] and drink water instead. His supervisor, Melzar, was afraid to displease the king. He thought that after eating pulse and water, the selected Israelites would look worse than their peers, and he would be punished (Daniel 1:8-10).\nWith an understanding of the background of the situation, Daniel proposed an experiment. He said, Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants (Daniel 1:12-13.). In short, Daniel’s implied research question can be stated as: Will those who eat pulse and drink water appear healthier than those who eat the king’s meat and drink his wine? Melzar agreed to the experiment.\n\nAnswer the following question:\n\n\n\nWhat is Daniel’s hypothesis?\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\nDaniel’s hypothesis is that the Israelite children who eat pulse and drink water will appear healthier in just ten days, compared to those who eat the king’s meat and drink his wine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Collect Data\n\nWhen designing a study, much attention is given to the process by which data are observed. When examining data, it is also important to understand the data collection procedures. A sample is a subset (a portion) of a population. How is this sample obtained? How are the observations made?\nDaniel’s study design required that data be collected at the end of 10 days. Melzar would compare the appearances of two groups of people: (1) Israelites who ate pulse and drank water versus (2) Israelites who ate the king’s meat and drank his wine.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Describe the Data\n\nWhen we describe data, we use any tools appropriate to the situation. This can include creating graphs or calculating statistics to help understand or visualize the data.\nFor Daniel’s experiment, the data are described in Daniel 1:15: And at the end of ten days [the] countenances [of those who ate pulse] appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Make Inferences\n\nInference is the process of using the information contained in a sample from a population to make a general statement (i.e. to infer something) about the entire population. Later in the course we will learn techniques that make this type of analysis possible.\nMelzar made an inference. Based on the results of the sample, he determined that (in general) those who eat pulse and drink water will be healthier than those who eat the king’s meat and drink his wine Daniel 1:15-16.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Take Action\n\nThe goal of a statistical analysis is to determine which action to take in a particular situation. Actions can include many things: launching an internet ad campaign (or not), expressing gratitude (or not), getting vaccinated (or not), etc.\nMelzar took action as described in Daniel 1:16: Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave [all the Israelite children] pulse.\nWas the experiment a success?\n“Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in… the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm” Daniel 1:18-20.\n\n\n\nSummary of the Statistical Process\n\nDaniel’s experience can also help you learn the Statistical Process. Look at the first letter of each of the steps in the Statistical Process. You can use the phrase “Daniel Can Discern More Truth” to help you to help you remember the five steps in the Statistical Process.\n\nThe Statistical Process\n\n\n\n\n \nPneumonic\nActual Process Step\n\n\n\n\nStep 1:\nDaniel\nDesign the study\n\n\nStep 2:\nCan\nCollect data\n\n\nStep 3:\nDiscern\nDescribe the data\n\n\nStep 4:\nMore\nMake inferences\n\n\nStep 5:\nTruth\nTake action\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Process will be used throughout the course.

Having a control group allows a researcher to see the effect of not taking any action. For Daniel, the control group (who ate the king’s meat and drank his wine) provided a basis for comparing the effect of the new treatment (i.e. eating pulse and drinking water.)"

    "text": "Design of Studies\nMost research projects can be classified into one of two basic categories: observational studies or designed experiments. In an experiment, researchers control (to some extent) the conditions under which measurements are made. In an observational study, researchers simply observe what happens, without controlling the conditions under which measurements are made. Both types of study follow the five steps of the Statistical Process.\n\n\nDesigned Experiments\nIn a designed experiment, researchers manipulate the conditions that the participants experience. They often do this by randomly assigning subjects to one of two groups, a “treatment” group (sometimes called the experimental group) and a “control” group (though this could be second treatment group instead of a control group). The experiment is typically conducted by applying some kind of treatment to the subjects in the treatment group and observing the effect of the treatment. Those in the control group do not receive the treatment and are also observed. In this way researchers can determine the effects of the treatment by comparing the treatment group results to the control group results. The following example illustrates the use of these two groups.\nJonas Salk’s First Polio Vaccine Trial\nBeginning around 1916 and through the 1950s, a mysterious plague attacked infants and children. Symptoms included excruciating muscle pain and a stiff neck. This illness, which became known as poliomyelitis or simply “polio,” left children disfigured, paralyzed, and sometimes even dead.\nWhile working as a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Dr. Jonas E. Salk developed a vaccine that might help prevent the spread of this disease. He conducted what has become one of the most famous designed experiments in history.\nThis short video below provides a compelling summary of the famous Jonas Salk vaccine experiment. As you watch, notice each of the 5 steps of a statistical study in this study.  \nAs explained in the video, in the first Salk trial almost 1.1 million children participated in the study. Even though the sample size was large, flaws in the study design rendered the results useless.\nUndaunted, Dr. Salk fixed the problems with the design and enrolled hundreds of thousands of additional children for the second phase of his study. In all, over 1.8 million infants and children participated in this experiment, making it the largest drug trial to date.\n\nStep 1: Design the study.\nThe participants in a study are commonly called subjects. Sometimes subjects are called experimental units or simply units. In the Salk trials, the children who participated were the subjects.\nSubjects (the children) were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group was given the experimental vaccine, the treatment. The treatment is the new or experimental condition that is imposed on the subjects. The subjects who receive the treatment make up the treatment group.\nThe second group was given a control or placebo. In this study, the control was an injection that looked just like the vaccine, but contained a harmless saline solution. The control group or placebo group is made up of the subjects assigned to receive the control.\nThis study was double blind. Neither the children’s parents nor their doctors knew whether a particular child received the treatment or the control. Both parties were blinded to this information.\nBecause the children were assigned to the groups randomly, the two groups should be similar. If the vaccine is not effective, the number of future cases of polio should be about the same in each group. However, if Salk’s vaccine helped to prevent the spread of polio, then fewer cases should occur in the vaccinated group.\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\nSome children can be identified as having a higher risk of developing polio. Would it have been better if they were assigned to the treatment group so they could get the vaccine?\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nNo. The two groups need to be as similar as possible. Specifically, the people in the treatment group need to have the same potential (on average) of contracting polio as the people in the control group. If we put the people who are at a higher risk of developing polio in the treatment group, we run the risk of having more people in the treatment group getting polio simply because they are more likely to get it, whether they are vaccinated or not. Likewise, we might have fewer people in the control group getting polio just because they are less likely to get it, whether they are vaccinated or not.\nThese two effects would create a bias against the vaccine, by making the vaccine look like it doesn’t work, or doesn’t work as well as it does. It might also make it appear that people who aren’t vaccinated stay healthy and the vaccine is not needed. There is even a chance that people will conclude that the vaccine actually gives people polio.\nRandomly assigning subjects to the two groups tends to yield groups with similar characteristics—in this example, similar potential for contracting polio. Randomly assigning subjects to groups therefore defends us against problems like those mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it important for the subject and those who assess the health of the subject to be unaware of whether or not that child received the vaccine?\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nSubjects: Suppose a subject in the study thinks they’re being treated. It has been documented that subjects with such knowledge tend to show improvement whether they are receiving the treatment or not. To see why, consider how you might feel and act if you were told you had been vaccinated. You might have a more hopeful outlook, leading to healthier living habits such as better hygiene and nutrition. Such changes would tend to reduce your chance of contracting polio whether you’ve received the vaccine or not. This might make the vaccine look like it works better than it does. It also might make the vaccine look like it works, even if it doesn’t.\nNow suppose subjects in the control group know they are not being treated. This can also change the way they feel and act, in ways that can make them more likely to contract polio than they would be if they weren’t in the study. This could make it look like the incidence of polio among unvaccinated persons is higher than it is, again making the vaccine look like it works better than it does.\nTo reduce bias caused by such errors, subjects should not know to which group they are assigned.\nResearchers: Suppose a researcher assessing the health of a subject is told that the subject is in the control group. It has been documented that in such a case, the researcher is more likely to record that the subject has symptoms even if the subject is not actually in the control group. This makes it look like unvaccinated persons are more likely to get polio than they really are, which makes it look like the vaccine works better than it does.\nThere are other effects of knowing to which group the subject belongs, such as doctors treating or advising the patient differently than they would without such knowledge. Such differences can make it harder to tell whether the vaccine works, and how well.\nTo reduce bias caused by such effects, those assessing the health of the subjects should not be told to which group the subject belongs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nStep 2: Collect data.\nThe researchers followed up with each child to determine if they contracted polio. They recorded the number of children in each group that developed polio during the study period. Not all of Salk’s experiments were double-blind. Here is a summary of the results from the regions where a double-blind study was conducted (Francis et al., 1955; Brownlee, 1955):\n\n\nChildren Who Developed Polio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Group\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n200,688\n\n\n\n\n200,745\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacebo Group\n\n\n\n\n142\n\n\n\n\n201,087\n\n\n\n\n201,229\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Describe the data.\nOne way to summarize the data is to compute the proportion of children in each group that developed polio. The proportion of children in the treatment group that developed polio during the study period is:\n\\[ \\frac{57}{200745} = 0.000~283~9 \\]\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\nCalculate the proportion of children in the placebo group that developed polio during the study period.\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\n\\[ \\displaystyle{\\frac{142}{201229} = 0.000~705~7} \\]\n\n\n\n\nCompare the two proportions. What do you observe?\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThe proportion of children in the placebo group that develop polio during the study period was more than double the proportion of children in the treatment group that developed polio during the study period. That suggests that the treatment is effective in reducing the proportion of children that will develop polio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Make inferences\nCareful statistical analysis of the records suggested that this difference was so great that it was attributable to the vaccine and not to chance. Assuming that the vaccine had no effect, the probability that the difference in the proportions between the two groups would be at least as extreme as the difference Dr. Salk observed was very low: 0.00000000093. Because this probability is so small, it is highly unlikely that these results are due to chance.\n\n\nStep 5: Take action\nOnce it was clear that the vaccine was effective, children who were unvaccinated or had received the placebo were given Salk’s vaccine. Since 1954, there has been a marked decrease in the number of polio cases worldwide (Offit, 2005). Public health researchers are striving to eradicate this disease entirely.\n\n\n\nObservational Studies\nIn an observational study researchers observe the responses of the individuals, without controlling the conditions experienced by the individuals. Therefore, they do not assign the participants to treatment or control groups.\nObservational studies commonly occur in business settings. One example is a financial audit. The purpose of a financial audit is to assess the accuracy of a company’s financial business practices. ImmunAvance Ltd., a non-government health care organization, hired the Accounting Office at Global Optimization Unlimited to perform an independent audit of their financial practices. ImmunAvance provides inoculation and other preventative health care services in rural African communities.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Design the study\nThe volume of financial transactions conducted by ImmunAvance makes it impossible to conduct a census or an examination of the entire collection of ImmunAvance’s financial documents. Instead, you will collect a manageable group of items (called the sample) from the entire collection of financial documents (called the population.) A sample is a subset or a portion of a population. The information gained from the sample is used to make an inference (or generalization) about the population.\nAuditors typically cannot consider every item in a population, because there are too many. When it is not possible to conduct a census, auditors face sampling risk. Sampling risk is the risk affiliated with not auditing every item in the population. It is the risk that the sample may not adequately reflect the population. The only way to eliminate sampling risk is to conduct a census, which is usually not practical. Auditors can reduce sampling risk by obtaining a sample randomly. This is called random selection. Another way to reduce sampling risk is to increase the sample size, the number of items sampled.\n\n\n\n\nSampling Methods\nStep 2: Collect data\nThere are several procedures that can be used to select a random sample from a population, including: simple random sampling (SRS), stratified sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling, , and convenience sampling (or, haphazard sampling). These are examples of sampling methods.\n\nRandom Sampling Methods\nA simple random sample (SRS) is the best method for obtaining a sample from a population. This method allows each possible sample of a certain size an equal chance at being selected as the chosen sample. A difficulty of this method is that a list of all of the items in the population must be accessible before the sample is taken. Often, we obtain a SRS by allowing a computer to randomly select a certain number of items from the full list of the population. It is akin to the idea of putting all of the names into a hat, shaking them up, and randomly drawing out a few.\n\nFor example, suppose there are 18,000 students in the population of a certain university. School officials can use a computer to randomly choose values between 1 and 18,000 to identify which students are to be selected to complete a survey. In Excel, the command to obtain a random number between 1 and 18,000 is =RANDBETWEEN(1,18000). A simple random sample can be obtained any time there is a complete list of the items to be sampled and they are all accessible. All the statistical procedures in this course assume that simple random sampling has been used. But in practice, the SRS is often difficult (or impossible) to implement.\n\nA stratified sample is when the items to be sampled are organized in groups of homogeneous (similar) items called strata, then a simple random sample is drawn from each of these strata. Stratified sampling works well when the items are similar within each stratum and tend to differ from one stratum to another. We often use stratified sampling in order to obtain a sample in such a way that we can make comparisons between each of the groups (or strata).\n\nFor example, in obtaining a sample of students from a university, school officials could define the strata as: (1) freshman, (2) sophomores, (3) juniors, and (4) seniors. A simple random sample could then be obtained from each of these strata. This would ensure that each class rank of students was represented in the sample. It would also allow the school officials to see how freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior level students compared in their answers to a survey.\n\nA systematic sample is where every \\(k^{\\text{th}}\\) item in the population is selected to be part of the sample, beginning at a random starting point. Systematic sampling works well when the items are in a random, but sequential ordering. If the items are not arranged randomly, a systematic sample can miss important parts of the population.\n\nFor example, consider a fast food company where every 10th customer is given the opportunity to compete a satisfaction survey in exchange for a small discount coupon towards their next purchase. An airport security line also often implements a procedure where every 100th (or so) person is selected for a more “in depth” security examination. Similarly, factories that use assembly lines will pull say every 500th item from the assembly line to perform a quality control check on the item.\n\nA cluster sample (sometimes called a block sample) consists of taking all items in one or more randomly selected clusters, or blocks. When the variation from one block to another is relatively low, compared to the variation within the block, cluster sampling is a reasonable way to get a sample.\n\nFor example, ecologists could draw grids on a map of a forest to create small sampling regions, or sampling clusters. Then, by randomly selecting one or two of these clusters from the map, the ecologists could go to the areas marked on the map and document information on the health of every tree they find in those clusters. This is a practical way to get a sample in this case because the ecologists only have to go to a few areas of the forest, but are still able to obtain a random sample of all of the trees in the forest. It is also worth noting that the ecologists would not be interesting in comparing the health of the trees from the selected clusters to each other like they would in a stratified sample. Instead, they are just looking for a feasible way to obtain a single random sample of all of the trees in the forest, but want to keep their traveling time to a minimum while collecting their sample. In contrast, to obtain a simple random sample of trees from the same forest, the ecologists would first have to go out and number every tree in the entire forest. Then they would need to use a computer to randomly pick which trees to collect data on. Finally, they would then have to go back to the forest and collect data on the selected trees from across the entire forest. Such an approach just isn’t feasible in practice, so we are willing to settle instead for the cluster sample.\n\nA convenience sample involves selecting items that are relatively easy to obtain and does not use random selection to choose the sample. This method of sampling can be assumed to always bring bias into the sample.\n\nAs an example of a convenience sample, an auditor could haphazardly select items from a filing cabinet. This is frequently done when a quick and simple sample is needed, but may not yield a sample that represents the population well. When possible, convenience samples should be avoided.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Data\nWhenever we collect data, we record information about the things we are studying. There are two basic types of data that can be recorded: quantitative measurements and categorical labels. We will call these types of data simply “quantitative” or “categorical” variables. We use the word “variable” to denote the idea that the quantitative measurements or categorical labels can vary from person to person, or item to item, in our study.\nQuantitative variables provide measurement information on each individual (or item) in our study. They represent things that are numeric in nature; things that are measured. They often include units of measurement along with the quantitative value of the measurement. For example, the heights of children measured in inches (or centimeters), or their weight measured in pounds (or kilograms). For a quantitative variable, it makes sense to apply arithmetic operations to the data (such as adding values together, computing the average of the values, or comparing two values). If one child weighs 30 pounds (13.61 kg) and a second child weights 60 pounds (27.22) then the second child is twice as heavy as the first.\nCategorical variables allow us to place each individual (or item) into to a specific category. Categorical variables are labels, and it does not make sense to do arithmetic with them. For example the gender of a newborn child, the ethnicity of an individual, a person’s job title, the brand of phone they own, or the area code of a telephone number, etc are all categorical variables. Notice that although a telephone number consists of numbers, it is not a quantitative measurement. It does not make sense to double someone’s phone number, to average phone numbers together, or to say one phone number is half the size of another. But the area code of the phone number gives information about the region where the phone number was first initiated, which is categorical information.\nIn Unit 3 of this course we will learn more about categorical variables and proportions. Units 1 and 2 of this course focus on studying quantitative variables.\nReturning to the sample accounts receivable record, we find this data to have information on both types of variables.\n\nAnswer the following question:\n\n\n\nFor each of the following variables taken from this accounts receivable record, indicate whether the variable is quantitative or categorical.\n\n\n\nTerms\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThe variable “Terms” is categorical. It classifies the invoice by the terms of payment for that invoice.\n\n\n\n\nAccount number\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThe variable “Account number” is categorical. Even though the account number is given a number, it is actually functioning as a label. It is not something that is counted or measured. It does not make sense to do arithmetic operations (like adding 1 or multiplying by 2) to the account number.\n\n\n\n\nInvoice amount\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThe variable “Invoice amount” is quantitative. It makes sense to do arithmetic operations to this value. For example, the amount of Invoice 5745 (which is $990.00) is somewhat more than twice as much as that of Invoice 2378 (which is $478.00).\n\n\n \n\n\n\nStep 3: Describe the data\nAfter auditors collect a sample and compile the data, they review the evidence. Auditors may use graphs or compute numbers (such as the average) to summarize the evidence they found."

    "text": "Making Inferences: Hypothesis Testing\nStep 4: Make inferences\nAuditors use the information drawn from the sample to form an opinion about the population. Whenever sample data is used to infer a characteristic of a population, it is called making an inference. Inferential statistics represents a collection of methods that can be used to make inference about a population. Based on the documents reviewed, the auditors assess if the company is conducting its business in a proper manner.\nWhen conducting an audit, the implicit assumption is that transactions have been posted properly. As auditors sample the company’s records, they are looking to see if everything is consistent with the original assumption that all transactions have been posted properly. It would only be in the case of discovering suspicious activity or evidence of fraudulent reporting that the auditors would change their belief about the company and accuse the company ImmunAvance of falsely reporting on their financial statements.\n\n“Piled Higher and Deeper” by Jorge Cham  \n\nThere is a formal procedure for determining when enough evidence has been found to make accusations of fraud. Later this semester, after we establish some foundational principles of statistics, we will study these statistical methods in depth. Of course, these methods can be used for much more than just determining if a company has reported their financial statements fraudulently. So we will look at many different ways these statistical procedures can be applied to research and industry.\nFor ImmunAvance’s audit, based on the samples of financial statements that had been selected, while there were a few errors in the documents, there was not evidence dramatic enough to claim that the company had been fraudulent. So the company passed their audit.\n\nStep 5: Take Action\nThe auditors prepare a report in which they give their opinion on the status of the company’s current operations.\nSince there was not enough evidence to suggest that ImmunAvance’s financial statements were fraudulent, the auditor’s conclusion is that no adjustment is necessary. The few observed discrepancies were apparently just the result of random chance errors, not the deliberate falsefying of information."

These can be remembered by the pneumonic “Daniel Can Discern More Truth.”\nIn a designed experiment, researchers control the conditions of the study, typically with a treatment group and a control group, and then observe how the treatments impact the subjects. In a purely observational study, researchers don’t control the conditions but only observe what happens.\nThe population is the entire group of all possible subjects that could be included in the study. The sample is the subset of the population that is actually selected to participate in the study. Statistics use information from the sample to make claims about what is true about the entire population.\nThere are many sampling methods used to obtain a sample from a population. The best methods use some sort of randomness (like pulling names out of a hat, rolling dice, flipping coins, or using a computer generated list of random numbers) to avoid bias.\n\n\nA simple random sample (SRS) is a random sample taken from the full list of the population. This is the least biased (best) sampling method, but can only be implemented when a full list of the population is accessible.\nA stratified sample divides the population into similar groups and then takes an SRS from each group. The main reason to use this sampling method is when a study wants to compare and contrast certain groups within the population, say to compare freshman, sophomores, juniors, and seniors at a university.\nA systematic sample samples every kth item in the population, beginning at a random starting point. This is best applied when subjects are lined up in some way, like at a fast food restaurant, an airport security line, or an assembly line in a factory.\nA cluster sample consists of taking all items in one or more randomly selected clusters, or blocks. For example, ecologists could draw grids on a map of a forest to create small sampling regions and then sample all trees they find in a few randomly selected regions. Note that this differs from a stratified sample in that only a few sub-groups (clusters) are selected and that all subjects within the selected clusters are included in the study.\nA convenience sample involves selecting items that are relatively easy to obtain and does not use random selection to choose the sample. This method of sampling can be assumed to always bring bias into the sample.\n\n\nThe best way to avoid bias when trying to make conclusions about a population from a single sample of that population is to use a random sampling method to obtain the sample.\nQuantitative variables represent things that are numeric in nature, such as the value of a car or the number of students in a classroom. Categorical variables represent non-numerical data that can only be considered as labels, such as colors or brands of shoes."

In 2009, nine million new cases of tuberculosis were diagnosed, leading to almost 2 million deaths worldwide. Currently, the principal vaccine used to prevent tuberculosis is Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG). Unfortunately, BCG is only moderately effective at preventing tuberculosis. Historically, India has had a high number of tuberculosis cases. The Indian Government wants to reduce the prevalence of this disease.\nIn this activity, you will compare the average costs of treating a person who contracts tuberculosis to the costs of preventing a case of tuberculosis in India.\n  Step 2: Collect data.\nHealth Care records of tuberculosis patients in India were surveyed to estimate the cost to treat patients with tuberculosis. The following data are representative of the total costs (in US dollars) incurred by society in the treatment of 10 randomly selected tuberculosis patients in India.\n\n15,100     19,000     4,800     6,500     14,900     600     23,500     11,500     12,900     32,200\n\nThese costs include health care treatment, time missed from work, and in some cases utility lost due to death.\n  Step 3: Describe the data.\n\nVisualizing Quantitative Data: Histograms\nThe following data are representative of the total costs (in US dollars) incurred by society in the treatment of 10 randomly selected tuberculosis patients in India.\n\n15,100     19,000     4,800     6,500     14,900     600     23,500     11,500     12,900     32,200\n\nTo help us visualize these data, we will create a graph called a histogram. To make a histogram, we will divide the number line from 0 to 35,000 in seven equal parts. We will then count the number of data points in each of these intervals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterval\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 0 and less than 5,000\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 5,000 and less than 10,000\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 10,000 and less than 15,000\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 15,000 and less than 20,000\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 20,000 and less than 25,000\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 25,000 and less than 30,000\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 30,000 and less than 35,000\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each of these intervals, called bins, we draw a bar on the histogram. The width of the bars is determined by the width of the bin (5000 in this example). The height of the bars is equal to the number of observations that fall in each bin. As we look at the histogram shown below, we see bars ranging from $0 to $35,000. We also see higher bars in the middle between $10,000 to $20,000 show that these values are more commonly occurring than the other values. If we computed the average of the values contained in our histogram, we would compute the number \\[\n  \\frac{15,100 + 19,000 + 4,800 + 6,500 + 14,900 + 600 + 23,500 + 11,500 + 12,900 + 32,200}{10} = 14,100\n\\] showing that the center of the histogram (or average) is at $14,100.\n\nThis is a histogram created in R: \n\n\n\nTo create this histogram in R, you can copy and paste the following code into R:\n\n# Create a dataset with the costs from 10 randomly selected patients:\ndata &lt;- c(15100, 19000, 4800, 6500, 14900, 600, 23500, 11500,12900, 32200)\n\n# Create a histogram. We add x-axis labels using `xlab = \"\"` and a title `main = \"\"`\nhist(c(15100, 19000, 4800, 6500, 14900, 600, 23500, 11500,12900, 32200), xlab=\"Treatment Costs\", main = \"Tuberculosis Costs in India\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Inference About the Population\nAfter summarizing the data from our sample of the populations both numerically and graphically, we can use this information to make inference about the full population. \n  Step 4: Make inferences.\nIn the past, the total average cost to society to treat a case of tuberculosis in India was known to be $13,800. As shown in our Step 3 calculations, the 10 randomly selected patients showed an average cost that was higher than the historic value at $14,100. This might make us believe that the actual total average cost to society is also $14,100. However, in depth statistical calculations (that you will be taught how to do later this semestr) show that there is a 46% chance that our sample had an average of $14,100 just by random chance. This isn’t too hard to believe since we only had a sample size of 10 people, and $14,100 is only $300 above $13,800, so it turns out to be fairly likely (46% chance) that because of random chance our sample had an average that was a little higher than the actual value from the population. So we will conclude that the total average cost to society is still essentially the same as it has been in the past.\n\n  Step 5: Take action.\nAfter making inferences, you take action. The motivation for conducting a study like this is usually to see if there is inflation in the costs.\n\nAnswer the following question:\n\n\n\nGiven our conclusion in Step 4 (that the results of our random sample being at an average $14,100 had a 46% probability of just being caused by random chance) do you think the Government of India needs to take any special action to stop the increase in the cost to treat tuberculosis?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nAnswers may vary. – However, we could not say that the true mean cost has really changed from $13,800. So, there is not enough evidence of inflation. There is no need for the Government of India to take action.\n\n\n\n\nOne benefit of using a histogram is that it allows you to visualize the distribution of the data. A histogram illustrates the overall shape of the distribution of the data. The height of the bars show how many observations fall in that range.\n\nAnswer the following question:\n\n\n\nWhich bin of the histogram of tuberculosis costs contained the most data points?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThe bin going from $10,000 to $15,000 contained 3 observations ($11,500, $12,900, and $14,900), which was the most of any of the bins in the histogram. This can be seen visually in the histogram by looking at the height of each bar and the starting and stopping points of the bar along the x-axis of the graph.\n\n\n\n\nWe will describe the shape of the distribution of a data set using the following basic categories: symmetric, bell-shaped, skewed right, and skewed left. Additionally, we can label the shape of a distribution as uniform, unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal.\nA distribution is symmetric if both the left and right side of the distribution appear to be roughly a mirror image of each other. A special symmetric distribution is a bell-shaped distribution. When data follow a bell-shaped distribution, the histogram looks like a bell. Bell-shaped distributions play an important role in Statistics and will play a role in most of the future lessons.\nA distribution is right-skewed if a histogram of the distribution shows a long right tail. This can occur if there are some very large outliers on the right-hand side of the distribution. A distribution is left-skewed if a histogram shows that it has a long tail to the left.\n\n\n\nRight-skewed\n\n\nSymmetric & Bell-shaped\n\n\nLeft-skewed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean: $10.45\nMedian: $9.04\nMean is to the right of the median.\n\n\nMean: 71.1 inches\nMedian: 71 inches\nMean and median are roughly equal.\n\n\nMean: 3.42\nMedian: 3.45\nMean is to the left of the median.\n\n\n\n\nIf a distribution has only one peak, it is said to be unimodal. The three distributions illustrated above are all unimodal distributions. Some people might argue that there are several peaks in the GPA data, so it should not be considered unimodal. Even though there are jagged bumps in the histogram, it is important to visualize the overall shape in the data. When interpreting a histogram, it can be helpful to blur your eyes and imagine the overall shape after smoothing out the bumps. If the overall trend indicates that there is more than one bump, then we do not consider the distribution to be unimodal. We will usually only work with unimodal data sets in this course.\nSome distributions have no distinct peak, others have more than one peak. When there is no distinct peak, and the histogram shows a relatively flat shape, we might say the data follow a uniform distribution. If there are two distinct peaks, a distribution is called bimodal. If there are more than two peaks, we refer to the distribution as multimodal."

    "text": "Center of a Distribution\n\nStep 3: Describe the data.\nSometimes people talk about the “typical” BYU-Idaho student or the average waiting time for a bus. But what does it mean for something or someone to be “average?” How can we quantify what it means to be typical or average? In the example below, we will explore one way to define what “average” means.\nWhen we talk about the “typical” or “average” value, we are essentially describing the center of a population. If we want to estimate the “average” costs to treat a tuberculosis patient, there are several ways we can do it.\n\n\nMeasuring the Center of a Distribution\n\nMean\nThe sample mean or sample arithmetic mean is the most common tool to estimate the center of a distribution. It is referred to simply as the mean. It is computed by adding up the observed data and dividing by the number of observations in the data set.\nIn Statistics, important ideas are given a name. Very important ideas are given a symbol. The sample mean has both a name (mean) and a symbol (\\(\\bar x\\), called “x-bar”).\n\\[\n  \\bar{x} \\text{ is used to denote the sample mean}\n\\]\nYou may have heard people refer to the sample mean as the average. Technically, the word average refers to any number that is used to estimate the center of a distribution. The mean, median and mode are all examples of “averages.” To avoid confusion, it is best to use the words mean, median, and mode instead of the word average, so that it is clear which “average” your are referencing.\n\nAnswer the following question:\n\n\n\nPractice finding the mean, \\(\\bar x\\), for the tuberculosis treatment costs of the 10 patients in India by simplifying the following: \\[\\bar x=\\frac{15100 + 19000 + 4800 + 6500 + 14900 + 600 + 23500 + 11500 + 12900 + 32200}{10}=\\]\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThe mean cost to treat the 10 TB patients in India is: \\(\\bar x = \\$14,100\\). To see how to calculate the mean in Excel, see the “Excel Instructions” below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian\nThe median is the middle value in a sorted data set. Half of the observations in the data set are below the median and half are above the median. To find the median, you:\n\nSort the values from smallest to largest\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nIf there are an odd number of values, the median is the middle value in the sorted list.\nIf there are an even number of values, the median is the mean of the two middle values in the sorted list.\n\n\n\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\nPractice finding the median of the tuberculosis treatment costs for the 10 patients in India. First, sort the data from smallest to largest.\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\n600\n4800\n6500\n11500\n12900\n14900\n15100\n19000\n23500\n32200\n\n\n\n\nSince there are an even number of observations (n=10), the median is computed as the mean of the middle two values. Use your answer to the previous question to find the median of the data. What is the median?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\n600\n4800\n6500\n11500\n12900\n14900\n15100\n19000\n23500\n32200\n\nThe middle two numbers are 12900 and 14900. The mean of these two numbers is:\n\n\\(\\text{Median } = \\frac{12900 + 14900}{2} = 13900\\)\n\nThe median cost to treat the ten TB patients in India is $13,900.\n\n\n\n\n\nMode\nThe most frequently occurring value is called the mode. Sometimes there is more than one mode. For example, in the data set\n\\[{1,~~2, ~~2, ~~2, ~~3, ~~4, ~~4, ~~5, ~~5, ~~5, ~~6}\\]\nthe modes are 2 and 5. Both of these values occur three times, which is more times than any other value.\nIf no number occurs more than once in the data set, we say that there is no mode. For the data set representing the costs to treat tuberculosis in India, none of the values is repeated. So, there is no mode for these data.\n\nAnswer the following question:\n\n\n\nFor a particular data set, which of the following can occur?\n\n\nThere may be no mode.\nThere may be exactly one mode.\nThere may be several modes.\nOnly A and B can occur.\nA, B, and C can all occur.\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nA, B, and C can all occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcel Instructions for Mean, Median, and Mode\n\nR Instructions\n\n\n\nTo calculate most numerical summaries (such as the mean, median, and mode) in Excel, follow these general steps:\n\nOpen R.\nEnter the data using the “assignment operator”, &lt;-, and c() which establishes a “collection” of things, in this case numbers.\n\nCalculate summary statisti\nThen, highlight the data (by clicking on it) to which you want to apply the function. The cell reference range will automatically be added to your formula. Then type a closed parenthesis, “)” and hit enter.\n\nCaculate a Mean\nFor example, to calculate the mean of the sample of tuberculosis patient costs in India:\n\n# Create a dataset called `data` with the costs from 10 randomly selected patients:\ndata &lt;- c(15100, 19000, 4800, 6500, 14900, 600, 23500, 11500,12900, 32200)\n\nmean(data)\n\n[1] 14100\n\n\n\nCalculate a Median\nSimply replace the word “mean” in the formula with the word “median”. Try it with the tuberculosis patient data, you should get the same value that was calculated by hand above.\n\nmedian(data)\n\n[1] 13900\n\n\n\nCalculate a Mode\nR makes it difficult to use the mode because there are fewer situations when it is useful for quantitative data where few values repeat. In the rare occasion we are not interested in a mean or median, we can tabulate the frequency of specific values using the table() function:\n\n# Create a new dataset called data2:\ndata2 &lt;- c(3,4,9,5,2,3,5,4,2,3,1,5,3,1,2,6,2,4,6,2,2,2,9,1,2,7,8)\n\n# The `table()` function counts up all the times specific values show up.  This works for numbers or categories:\ntable(data2)\n\ndata2\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n3 8 4 3 3 2 1 1 2 \n\n\nThe first row of the table() output is the value being counted. The second row is the frequency of occurrence.\nWhich value is most frequently occurring?\nIf there are lots of occuring values, we can use R to sort() the table output to make it easier to see which is the mode:\n\nsort(table(data2))\n\ndata2\n7 8 6 9 1 4 5 3 2 \n1 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 8 \n\n\nThe rows are the same as before but are sorted in ascending order. We can now easily see that 2 occurred 8 times making 2 the mode.\n\n\n\nParameters and Statistics\nWe only have data on the cost to treat ten randomly selected tuberculosis patients. This represents a random sample from the population. The sample obtained by the researchers depends on random chance. If the study was repeated and a new sample of ten patients was randomly drawn from all cases of tuberculosis in India, would we observe the same data values? Certainly not!\nHowever, if we took a second random sample from the population, we would expect the mean of the new sample to be somewhat similar to the mean for our original sample. And if we took a third sample of data, we should expect the mean of this sample to be different than the means of the other two samples. In fact, every sample will give us a different sample mean, but all of these sample means will be fairly similar in value.\nOne of the primary purposes of collecting and analyzing data is to estimate the true mean of a population. Since collecting data on the entire population is usually not feasible, we usually never know what the true mean is. So we estimate the true population mean with the sample mean from a single sample of data from the population.\nThe sample mean is an example of a statistic. A statistic is a number that describes a sample. The true (usually unknown) population mean is an example of a parameter. A parameter is any number that describes a population.\nAn easy way to distinguish between a parameter and a statistic is to note the repetition in the first letters:\n\nPopulation Parameter True (usually unknown) value describing a population\nSample Statistic Estimate of the population parameter obtained from a sample\n\nIn the example above, the sample mean \\(\\bar x\\) = $14,100 is a statistic. Over the last few years, the total mean cost to treat tuberculosis in India has been $13,800. This $13,800 is considered a parameter because it is the “known” value for the full population.\nDifferent symbols are used to distinguish between the sample mean (a statistic) and the population mean (a parameter). The symbol for the sample mean is \\(\\bar x\\). The symbol for the population mean is \\(\\mu\\).\nPerspective\nThe mean cost to treat the ten tuberculosis patients in the sample was \\(\\bar x\\) = $14,100. This number gives us some useful information. However, if this was all we were given, we would not be able to distinguish the data above from a situation where the cost for each of the ten patients was exactly $14,100. Notice that if the cost for each patient was $14,100, the mean would be:\n\\[\\bar x=\\frac{14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100}{10} =14,100\\]\nEven though measures of center are important, we need to consider the shape, center and spread of a distribution of data. When evaluating data, it is sometimes tempting to compute a mean but to avoid creating a histogram. This can lead to errant decisions based on a misunderstanding or incorrect transcription of data. If there is a transcription error in the data, it is sometimes easiest to detect it as an outlier in a histogram."

The number of data points occurring in each interval (called a bin) are counted. A bar is then drawn for each bin so that the height of the bar shows the number of data points contained in that bin.\nA histogram allows us to visually interpret data to quickly recognize which values are most common and which values are least common in the data.\nHistograms can be left-skewed (the majority of the data is on the right of the histogram, less common values stretch to the left side), right-skewed (majority of the data is on the left side with less common values stretching to the right), or symmetrical and bell-shaped (most data is in the middle with less common values stretching out to either side).\nThe mean, median, and mode are measures of the center of a distribution. The mean is the most common measure of center and is computed by adding up the observed data and dividing by the number of observations in the data set.

    "text": "Probability is a way of numerically quantifying how likely an event is to happen or not happen. The following historical account demonstrates this idea and shows how fractions (like 1/2 or 3/4) or percentages (like 50% or 75%) can be used to represent probabilities.\n\n\n\nOn August 3, 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain for his intended destination: the Indies (Caso, Adolph 1990). He was on the Santa Maria, which had a crew of approximately 41 men (“Cristobal colon” 1991; “Christopher Columbus”). Several other men were aboard the Nina and the Pinta (“Cristobal colon” 1991). On October 12, he landed on an island in the Bahamas he called San Salvador.\nThe return trip was not without challenges. The Santa Maria ran aground on Christmas Day, 1492, and was abandoned on the island we now call Hispaniola (home to Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Following this incident, Columbus sailed for Spain. Severe storms made the journey difficult. A particularly bad storm on February 14, 1493 made the crew fear for their lives. By morning, the storm was even worse!\nRecognizing his dependence upon God, Columbus ordered that a pilgrimage should be made to a particular shrine upon their safe arrival in Spain. He decided that they would use random chance to determine who would make the pilgrimage. They took one chick pea for each man on board. A knife was used to mark one of the chick peas with a cross. The chick peas were placed in a hat and shaken up. Each man was to draw a chick pea, and the one who had the cross would make the pilgrimage.\n“The first who put in his hand was [Columbus,] and he drew out the bean with a cross, so the lot fell on him; and he was bound to go on the pilgrimage and fulfil the vow” (Caso, Adolph 1990).\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\nRemember, there were 41 men aboard his ship. What is the probability that Columbus would draw out the marked chick pea? Express your answer as a fraction, and then convert it to a decimal.\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\nThere is only one marked chick pea in the hat, out of 41 chick peas total. Out of is expressed arithmetically by division. The probability is \\(\\frac{1}{41} = 0.0244\\). (Note: this is about 2%.)\n\n\nBased on your answer to the previous question, how likely is it that Columbus would draw out the marked chick pea?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThere is only about a 2% chance that Columbus will draw out the marked Chick Pea. This is not very likely.\n\n\n\n\nA Second Drawing\nColumbus’ promise to make the pilgrimage did not stop the storm. It was determined that there should be a pilgrimage to another site they held sacred. Again, chick peas representing each member of the crew were placed in a hat and shaken up. The lot fell on a sailor…named Pedro de Villa (Caso, Adolph 1990).\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that Columbus would not draw out the marked chick pea? Express your answer as a fraction, and then covert it to a decimal?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThere are 40 other men on board plus Columbus. So, the probability that Columbus would not draw out the marked chick pea is: \\(\\frac{40}{41} = 0.9756\\). (Note: this is almost 98%.)\n\n\n\nBased on your answer to the previous question, how likely is it that Columbus would not draw out the marked chick pea?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nIt is very likely that Columbus would not draw out the marked chick pea. This result is not surprising.\n\n\n\nIn this second drawing, either Columbus would draw out the marked chick pea, or he would not. Add the probability that Columbus would draw out the marked chick pea and the probability that he would not draw out the marked chick pea. What is the value of this sum?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThe sum of the probabilities is 1:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{41} + \\frac{40}{41} = \\frac{41}{41} = 1\n\\]\n\n\n\nAdditional Drawings\nAfter the drawing in which Pedro de Villa was chosen to make a pilgrimage, two additional drawings were held. In both cases, Columbus drew out the marked chick pea (Caso, Adolph 1990). In all, Christopher Columbus drew the marked chick pea in three of the four drawings. It can be shown that the probability that this would occur due to chance is very small: 0.0000566.\nBonus material. Read only if you are interested.\nThis calculation is more involved than the calculations you will be required to make in this course this semester.

    "text": "Probability is a way of numerically quantifying how likely an event is to happen or not happen. The following historical account demonstrates this idea and shows how fractions (like 1/2 or 3/4) or percentages (like 50% or 75%) can be used to represent probabilities.\n\n\n\nOn August 3, 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain for his intended destination: the Indies (Caso, Adolph 1990). He was on the Santa Maria, which had a crew of approximately 41 men (“Cristobal colon” 1991; “Christopher Columbus”). Several other men were aboard the Nina and the Pinta (“Cristobal colon” 1991). On October 12, he landed on an island in the Bahamas he called San Salvador.\nThe return trip was not without challenges. The Santa Maria ran aground on Christmas Day, 1492, and was abandoned on the island we now call Hispaniola (home to Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Following this incident, Columbus sailed for Spain. Severe storms made the journey difficult. A particularly bad storm on February 14, 1493 made the crew fear for their lives. By morning, the storm was even worse!\nRecognizing his dependence upon God, Columbus ordered that a pilgrimage should be made to a particular shrine upon their safe arrival in Spain. He decided that they would use random chance to determine who would make the pilgrimage. They took one chick pea for each man on board. A knife was used to mark one of the chick peas with a cross. The chick peas were placed in a hat and shaken up. Each man was to draw a chick pea, and the one who had the cross would make the pilgrimage.\n“The first who put in his hand was [Columbus,] and he drew out the bean with a cross, so the lot fell on him; and he was bound to go on the pilgrimage and fulfil the vow” (Caso, Adolph 1990).\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\nRemember, there were 41 men aboard his ship. What is the probability that Columbus would draw out the marked chick pea? Express your answer as a fraction, and then convert it to a decimal.\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\nThere is only one marked chick pea in the hat, out of 41 chick peas total. Out of is expressed arithmetically by division. The probability is \\(\\frac{1}{41} = 0.0244\\). (Note: this is about 2%.)\n\n\nBased on your answer to the previous question, how likely is it that Columbus would draw out the marked chick pea?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThere is only about a 2% chance that Columbus will draw out the marked Chick Pea. This is not very likely.\n\n\n\n\nA Second Drawing\nColumbus’ promise to make the pilgrimage did not stop the storm. It was determined that there should be a pilgrimage to another site they held sacred. Again, chick peas representing each member of the crew were placed in a hat and shaken up. The lot fell on a sailor…named Pedro de Villa (Caso, Adolph 1990).\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that Columbus would not draw out the marked chick pea? Express your answer as a fraction, and then covert it to a decimal?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThere are 40 other men on board plus Columbus. So, the probability that Columbus would not draw out the marked chick pea is: \\(\\frac{40}{41} = 0.9756\\). (Note: this is almost 98%.)\n\n\n\nBased on your answer to the previous question, how likely is it that Columbus would not draw out the marked chick pea?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nIt is very likely that Columbus would not draw out the marked chick pea. This result is not surprising.\n\n\n\nIn this second drawing, either Columbus would draw out the marked chick pea, or he would not. Add the probability that Columbus would draw out the marked chick pea and the probability that he would not draw out the marked chick pea. What is the value of this sum?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nThe sum of the probabilities is 1:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{41} + \\frac{40}{41} = \\frac{41}{41} = 1\n\\]\n\n\n\nAdditional Drawings\nAfter the drawing in which Pedro de Villa was chosen to make a pilgrimage, two additional drawings were held. In both cases, Columbus drew out the marked chick pea (Caso, Adolph 1990). In all, Christopher Columbus drew the marked chick pea in three of the four drawings. It can be shown that the probability that this would occur due to chance is very small: 0.0000566.\nBonus material.
