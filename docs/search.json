    "text": "The Big 5 personality test is the most widely accepted tool for modelling personality in academic psychology. It is based on decades of statistical analysis of personality descriptions across languages and cultures. The big 5 traits are:\n\nOpenness\nConscientiousness\nExtroversion\nAgreeableness\nNeuroticism\n\nBrother Cannon collected personality data on students for the past several semesters, including a few metrics that may be associated with personality traits.\nNOTE: Scores for personality traits are given in percentiles relative to the general population.\nIn this activity, you will practice the process for approaching a dataset outlined in class:\n\nLoad the data and libraries\nExplore the data and generate hypotheses\nPrepare the data for analysis\nPerform the appropriate analysis\n\nData preparation will include using the filter() function. For now, analysis means creating good visualizations that tell a story using ggplot() and base R."
