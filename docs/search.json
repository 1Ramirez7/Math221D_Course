The shape of these distributions often depends on degrees of freedom which are related to the number of data points and/or the number of groups for categorical data.\n\nCalculate the P-value, the probability of observing the test statistic that we observed (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis were true.\nMake your conclusion by comparing the P-value to \\(\\alpha\\)\n\nWhen \\(\\text{P-value} &lt; \\alpha\\) we REJECT Ho in favor of Ha.

So, the overall proportion of people with a healthy weight is 100/200 = 0.5 (or 50%). If exercise has no effect on weight, we would expect 50% of the people who exercise to have a healthy weight.\nBecause a total of 80 people exercise regularly, we would expect \\(0.5 * 80 = 40\\) people to both exercise regularly and have a healthy weight.\nR will calculate the expected counts for every cell automatically.\nComparing Observed and Expected Counts:\nTo test the hypothesis that there is no relationship between exercise and weight, we compare what we actually observed to what we would expect if there was no relationship. Big differences between the observed and expected counts suggest that there is a relationship between the variables.\n\nFor example, we observed 60 people who exercise and have a healthy weight, but we expected only 40.

For regression analysis, we have to have 5 requirements for our statistics to be valid. While this sounds daunting, in practice we can check most of them very quickly.\n\nRelationship between X and Y is Linear\nThe residuals, \\(\\epsilon\\), are normally distributed\nThe Variance of the error terms is constant for all values of X\nThe X’s are fixed and measured without error (i.e. X’s can be considered as known constants)\nThe observations are independent\n\nThe linear relationship is assessed visually with the scatter plot. If there is obvious curvature or non-linearity then fitting a line isn’t the best model.\nWe check the normality of the residuals with a qqPlot(lm_output).\nConstant variance in regression is checked with a new plot that looks at how the predicted values relate to the residuals. This is done by: plot(lm_output, which=1). This is important because we want our predictions to be “wrong” about the same regardless of the value of the prediction. We’re looking for random scatter.\nRequirement 4 cannot be analyzed directly. It is important because because \\(x\\) is the independent variable. If there is uncertainty about the input, then the simple linear regression might not be the most appropriate model.\nRequirement 5 also cannot be analyzed, but random sampling usually satisfies this requirement.\n\n# Requirement 1:  Check for linear relationship\nggplot(math, aes(x=ConfidenceRatingMean, y = Score)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Req 2: Normality of residuals:\nqqPlot(math_lm$residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 37 89\n\n# Req 3: Constant variance (look odd patterns).

    "text": "Test Statistic\nThe Test Statistic for testing the relationship between a quantitative response variable and a categorical explanatory variable with &gt;2 categories is called \\(F\\).\nThe formula for \\(F\\) is complicated. But we can consider the signal-to-noise ratio as follows:\nSIGNAL: The variation between the means, ie. how far apart the group means are spread out.\nNOISE: The variation within groups. This variation represents the natural variation inherent in the data independent of any differences between the means.\n\\[ F=\\frac{\\text{Between-group Variation}}{\\text{Within-group Variation}}\\]\nLet’s look at an example to illustrate.\n\nSeed Treatment Experiment\nImagine you’re comparing 4 pesticide seed treatments for corn seeds. These treatments are all supposed to improve emergence uniformity and crop yield.\nThe null hypothesis is that seed treatment has no effect on crop yield. This is typically expressed as a statistical hypothesis by stating that the average emergence is the same regardless of which treatment you use.\nWe would express this as:\n\\[H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 = \\mu_4\\] PONDER: Can you see the connection between the treatment means being the same and “no relation” between treatment and emergence uniformity?\nThe alternative hypothesis for an \\(F\\)-statistics is:\n\\[H_a: \\text{at least one } \\mu_k \\text{ is different}\\]\nNote: The \\(F\\)-test does not tell us which group is different or how many are different from each other. The \\(F\\)-test only tells us that at least one mean is different.\nA good experiment would run multiple experimental trials on different farms. Ideally, we’d want a good random sample of farms in the area we expect to be planting.\nIf the null hypothesis were true, any differences observed between the treatment means should be due to random variation or “noise” inherent in growing corn. The within-treatment variation is a good estimate of the “noise” because it reflects the natural variability in seed yields when the null hypothesis is true.\nIf the null hypothesis is false, we would expect the treatment means to be much more spread out relative to the within-treatment variation.\nThe test statistic is the ratio of the variation between groups and the average variation within groups. The further spread out the sample means are relative to the noise within the groups, the more evidence we have against \\(H_0\\).\nA large F-statistics means the group averages are much more spread out than the natural variability in crop emergence.\n\n\nVisualizing Between-group and Within-group Variation\nWe can get a sense the signal and noise visually."

If the ratio of the biggest to the smallest is less than 2, we conclude that the population standard deviations are “equal”.\nNOTE: Intuitively, this means that if the biggest standard deviation is more than twice as big as the smallest, then we might have cause for concern.\nThis can be checked using the standard deviations from the favstats() output (see Analysis in R below)\n\n\nNormality of Residuals\nResiduals are defined as the difference between an observation and it’s “expected” value:\n\\[residual = \\text{observed}-\\text{expected}\\]\nIn the case of ANOVA, that means we get a residual for every observation by taking the observed value and subtracting its group mean.

    "title": "Statistical Significance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Statistical significance is a crucial concept for determining whether the results observed in a study are likely due to a real effect or simply due to chance. It’s a core component of hypothesis testing.\n\n\nThe \\(P\\)-value is the probability of observing results as extreme as or more extreme than the results obtained in your sample assuming the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it indicates how likely it is to see the data you did if there was actually no effect present.\nA small p-value suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, while a large p-value suggests the observed data are consistent with sample-to-sample variability.\n\n\n\nBefore starting a study, we set a threshold that can be used to determine if the \\(P\\)-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis. This number is called the level of significance and is denoted by the symbol \\(\\alpha\\) (pronounced “alpha”.)\nCommon values for \\(\\alpha\\) are 0.05, 0.01 and 0.1.\nWe will use the same decision rule for all hypothesis tests:\n\nIf the \\(P\\)-value is less than \\(\\alpha\\), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nIf the \\(P\\)-value is greater than \\(\\alpha\\), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nMemory Aid: If \\(P\\) is low, reject \\(H_O\\)\nWhere “low” means less than \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n\n\nWe can never be 100% certain that the signal observed in our sample was not just noise. Randomization is used to design statistical experiments to avoid bias in our samples, but sometimes that randomness can lead to results that look significant just by chance.\nConsider a clinical trial looking at 5-year survival rates for a new cancer therapy with 3 different levels of the treatment. We randomly assign patients to each treatment group.\nThere is a chance that the hardiest patients all end up in the same treatment group making it look like that treatment is better, but it wasn’t because of the treatment.\nWhen we conclude that there is a relationship between X and Y, when what we observed was actually “noise”, we have committed a Type I error.\nDEFINITION: Type I Error: Rejecting a TRUE null hypothesis. In some contexts this is called a FALSE POSITIVE\nBecause \\(\\alpha\\) is our decision point for rejecting the null hypothesis, \\(\\alpha\\) is the probability of rejecting a TRUE null hypothesis, meaning \\(\\alpha\\) is the probability of a Type I error.\nLet’s see what an \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) looks like in the case of against the foot-long sandwiches:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red area, \\(\\alpha\\), shows the probability of getting a sample mean in that tail when the null hypothesis is true. There’s always a chance we get such an extreme value and end up rejecting the null when it is true.\nIf we make \\(\\alpha\\) too small, we will reject \\(H_0\\) less often, thereby avoiding Type I errors. But that means that we are MORE likely to fail to reject the null hypothesis when we SHOULD have rejected it. This is a Type II error.\nDEFINITION: Type II Error: Failing to Reject a FALSE null hypothesis. In some contexts this is called a FALSE NEGATIVE\nFor example, if we failed to find evidence that the new cancer therapy worked but it really WAS effective, then we missed out on an a new, life-saving breakthrough.\n\n\n\nChoosing an appropriate alpha level involves balancing the risk of making Type I and Type II errors\nThe “best” choice for alpha depends on the context of the research. In exploratory research, a higher alpha (e.g., 0.10) might be acceptable to avoid missing potentially important effects. In situations where making a false positive conclusion could have serious consequences, a lower alpha (e.g., 0.01 or even lower) is preferred.\nIf the \\(\\alpha\\) value (the probability of committing a Type I error) is very small, the probability of committing a Type II error will be large. Conversely, if \\(\\alpha\\) is allowed to be very large, then the probability of committing a Type II error will be very small.\nA level of significance of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) seems to strike a good balance between the probabilities of committing a Type I versus a Type II error. However, there may be instances where it will be important to choose a different value for \\(\\alpha\\). The important thing is to choose \\(\\alpha\\) before you collect your data. Typical choices of \\(\\alpha\\) are \\(0.05\\) (most common), \\(0.1\\), and \\(0.01\\).\n\n\nThe graph below illustrates the relationship between Type I and Type II errors. The red distribution represents the Null Hypothesis, the sampling distribution of mean lengths of foot-long sandwiches, assuming \\(\\mu_0=12\\).\nThe blue distribution represents the “TRUE” distribution with a mean, \\(\\mu_{truth}=11.2\\). We never know this in the real world, but to illustrate, here is a situation where the true population mean is, in fact, less than 12. The right decision would be to REJECT \\(H_0\\).\nIf we set \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) (red shaded area), we can see that any sample mean to the right of the cutoff would fail to reject the null hypothesis. This mistake would be a Type II error.\nWhile we don’t know what the “TRUE” distribution is, we can see the relationship between moving the cutoff based on \\(\\alpha\\) would do to the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis even when it is FALSE."

Randomization is used to design statistical experiments to avoid bias in our samples, but sometimes that randomness can lead to results that look significant just by chance.\nConsider a clinical trial looking at 5-year survival rates for a new cancer therapy with 3 different levels of the treatment. We randomly assign patients to each treatment group.\nThere is a chance that the hardiest patients all end up in the same treatment group making it look like that treatment is better, but it wasn’t because of the treatment.\nWhen we conclude that there is a relationship between X and Y, when what we observed was actually “noise”, we have committed a Type I error.\nDEFINITION: Type I Error: Rejecting a TRUE null hypothesis.

But that means that we are MORE likely to fail to reject the null hypothesis when we SHOULD have rejected it. This is a Type II error.\nDEFINITION: Type II Error: Failing to Reject a FALSE null hypothesis.

    "text": "Choosing an appropriate alpha level involves balancing the risk of making Type I and Type II errors\nThe “best” choice for alpha depends on the context of the research. In exploratory research, a higher alpha (e.g., 0.10) might be acceptable to avoid missing potentially important effects. In situations where making a false positive conclusion could have serious consequences, a lower alpha (e.g., 0.01 or even lower) is preferred.\nIf the \\(\\alpha\\) value (the probability of committing a Type I error) is very small, the probability of committing a Type II error will be large. Conversely, if \\(\\alpha\\) is allowed to be very large, then the probability of committing a Type II error will be very small.\nA level of significance of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) seems to strike a good balance between the probabilities of committing a Type I versus a Type II error. However, there may be instances where it will be important to choose a different value for \\(\\alpha\\). The important thing is to choose \\(\\alpha\\) before you collect your data. Typical choices of \\(\\alpha\\) are \\(0.05\\) (most common), \\(0.1\\), and \\(0.01\\).\n\n\nThe graph below illustrates the relationship between Type I and Type II errors. The red distribution represents the Null Hypothesis, the sampling distribution of mean lengths of foot-long sandwiches, assuming \\(\\mu_0=12\\).\nThe blue distribution represents the “TRUE” distribution with a mean, \\(\\mu_{truth}=11.2\\). We never know this in the real world, but to illustrate, here is a situation where the true population mean is, in fact, less than 12. The right decision would be to REJECT \\(H_0\\).\nIf we set \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) (red shaded area), we can see that any sample mean to the right of the cutoff would fail to reject the null hypothesis. This mistake would be a Type II error.\nWhile we don’t know what the “TRUE” distribution is, we can see the relationship between moving the cutoff based on \\(\\alpha\\) would do to the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis even when it is FALSE."

    "text": "Assessing Normality\nIn practice, we must often confirm that the distribution of sample means is normally distributed. This is true when:\n\nThe population is normally distributed\n\\(n &gt; 30\\) because of the Central Limit Theorem\n\nBut how do you know if a population is normally distributed? In the real world, there is no teacher to tell you when to assume a population is normal.\nIf our sample size is large enough, we don’t have to worry. We can trust the Central Limit Theorem.\nIf \\(n &lt; 30\\), we can assess the normality of our sample to decide if we can still trust output of our statistical conclusions.\nPreviously, we’ve used histograms to help visualize the distribution of a sample. However, when sample sizes are small, even samples from a standard normal distribution can look skewed.\nAll of the examples below are histograms of random samples from actual standard normal distributions:\n\n\nA New Way to Assess Normality\nStatisticians use QQPlots which are better at assessing normality. QQPlots plot the ordered, observed percentiles for each data point in a dataset on the x-axis with the theoretical percentile from a normal distribution on the y-axis. If the observed percentiles and theoretical percentiles line up, then we can be reasonably sure the population is normally distributed.\nThese are easier to use than to explain. We use the car library and the function qqPlot() to create a chart. (Note the Capital P in the middle.)\nKey Point: If most of the data points line up in the shaded region, we can consider the population as normally distributed.\nBelow are examples of QQPlots for a normal distribution and a right skewed distribution.\n\n\nThese work much better for small sample sizes. Below are several examples of QQPlots for small sample sizes. They are the same samples as shown above in the histograms.\n\nWhile not perfect, these are a vastly better tool to assess normality than a histogram.\n\n\n\nPractice\nLet’s try assessing the normality of some data. Below are 3 datasets. Find the response variable(s) from each and determine if the data are sufficiently normally distributed:\n\nlibrary(rio)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(car)\n\nold_faithful &lt;- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/OldFaithful.xlsx')\n\nqqPlot(old_faithful$Duration)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 19 58\n\nqqPlot(old_faithful$Wait)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 265 127\n\nrent &lt;- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/Rent.csv')\n\n\nmcat_gpa &lt;- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/mcat_gpa.csv')"

The rules apply to any continuous probability distribution, but the normal distribution is one of the fundamental probability distributions in statistics. We will learn more about it in future lessons. For now, we use it only to illustrate the probability rules for continuous distributions.\nThe normal distribution is like a smooth histogram that is perfectly symmetric around the mean and has a standard deviation that determines how spread out the distribution is. Consider below a histogram of Major League Baseball batting averages:\n The smooth line is a normal distribution superimposed onto the histogram of the data. Using our data, we can calculate percentiles by adding up\nSuppose we want to estimate the probability that a randomly selected player will have a batting average that is greater than 0.280. One way to do this would be to find the proportion of players in the data set who have a batting average above 0.280. We can do this by finding the number of players who fall into each of the red-colored bins below and dividing this number by the total number of players.\n In other words, we could find the proportion of the total area of the bars that is shaded red out of the combined area of all the bars. This gives us the proportion of players whose batting averages are greater than 0.280.\nOut of the 446 players listed, there are a total of 133 players with batting averages over 0.280. This suggests that the proportion of players whose batting average exceeds 0.280 is:\n\\[\\displaystyle{\\frac{133}{446}} = 0.298\\]\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the data follow a bell-shaped distribution to find the probability that a player has a batting average above 0.280."

Because we are mainly interested in making inference about the primary statuses, we may want to filter out the rows with “It’s complicated” as the status.\nWe would begin with the raw data, “pipe” it into the filter() function and tell R what I want it to do. I can either tell R what I want to keep or what I want to exclude (more here):\nmarital_Status_data %&gt;% filter(marital_status != \"It's complicated\")\nNOTE: The != is read “not equal to”, and is a common logical operator used in computer programming.

About 19% of respondents are females who are not fans.\nThis is not typically the most interesting way to look at the data. We are more often interested in row or column proportions.\n\n\nRow Proportions\nWe can specify row proportions by including another input into the prop.table() function. We specify which margin to use as the denominator.\nRecall that the table() function will put the first input as the row and the second input as the column. To get row proportions, we tell R to divide by the row totals:\n\nprop.table(table(sw$Gender, sw$`Are You a Fan of SW?`), margin = 1)\n\n        \n                No       Yes\n  Female 0.3989899 0.6010101\n  Male   0.2819905 0.7180095\n\n\nQUESTION: What percent of males are fans of Star Wars?\nANSWER:\nQUESTION: What percent of females are fans of Star Wars?\nANSWER:\n\n\nColumn Proportions\nTo get column proportions, specify margin = 2 (the second input in the table() function)\n\nprop.table(table(sw$Gender, sw$`Are You a Fan of SW?`), margin = 2)\n\n        \n                No       Yes\n  Female 0.5703971 0.4399261\n  Male   0.4296029 0.5600739\n\n\nQUESTION: What percent of Star Wars fans are females?\nANSWER:\nQUESTION: What percent of Star Wars fans are males ?\nANSWER:"

You can specify the colors by adding the additional input col=c(2,3,4) or col=c(\"lightblue\", \"lightgreen\", \"darkred\",...) including as many colors as there are levels in the row variable.\n\nVisually, bar charts are the optimal way to express categorical data.

This process will be introduced in this lesson and will be used throughout the course.\n\n\nThe Statistical Process and Daniel’s Experiment\n\n\n\nStained-glass depiction of Daniel’s deliverance from the lions’ den. Found in the old Dominican priory church at Hawkesyard in Staffordshire, England. (Photo credit: Fr Lawrence Lew, O.P. Used by permission.)\n\n\n\nThe Old Testament prophet Daniel planned one of the earliest recorded scientific research studies. We will use his example to illustrate the following five steps of The Statistical Process.\nThe following icons can help you remember these steps. Notice that each icon has a letter and an image to help you remember the five steps of the Statistical Process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign the Study\n\n\n\nCollect the Data\n\n\n\nDescribe the Data\n\n\n\nMake Inference\n\n\n\nTake Action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Design the Study\n\nAn important step in scientific inquiry or problem solving can be to state a research question such as:\n\nWill internet advertising increase a company’s revenue?\nDoes expressing gratitude increase a person’s satisfaction with life in general?\nDoes a newly developed vaccine prevent the spread of disease?\n\nResearchers also investigate the background of the situation. What have other people discovered about this situation? How can we find the answer to the research question? What do we need to do? What is the population (or total collection of all individuals) under consideration? What kind of data need to be collected?\nBefore collecting data, researchers make a hypothesis, or an educated guess about the outcome of their research. A hypothesis is a statement such as the following:\n\nUsing internet advertising will increase the company’s sales revenue.\nPeople who express gratitude will be more satisfied with life than those who do not.\nA newly-developed vaccine is effective at preventing tuberculosis.\n\n\n\nDaniel’s Experiment\nAfter taking Israel captive, Babylon’s King Nebuchadnezzar asked his chief officer to bring Israelite children who were well favoured, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science to stand in the king’s palaces (Daniel 1:4). To aid their preparation, Nebuchadnezzar planned to feed them his meat and wine for three years (Daniel 1:5).\nDaniel did not want to defile himself by partaking of the king’s meat and wine. He asked permission to eat pulse[^1] and drink water instead. His supervisor, Melzar, was afraid to displease the king. He thought that after eating pulse and water, the selected Israelites would look worse than their peers, and he would be punished (Daniel 1:8-10).\nWith an understanding of the background of the situation, Daniel proposed an experiment. He said, Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants (Daniel 1:12-13.). In short, Daniel’s implied research question can be stated as: Will those who eat pulse and drink water appear healthier than those who eat the king’s meat and drink his wine? Melzar agreed to the experiment.\n\nAnswer the following question:\n\n\n\nWhat is Daniel’s hypothesis?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nDaniel’s hypothesis is that the Israelite children who eat pulse and drink water will appear healthier in just ten days, compared to those who eat the king’s meat and drink his wine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Collect Data\n\nWhen designing a study, much attention is given to the process by which data are observed. When examining data, it is also important to understand the data collection procedures. A sample is a subset (a portion) of a population. How is this sample obtained? How are the observations made?\nDaniel’s study design required that data be collected at the end of 10 days. Melzar would compare the appearances of two groups of people: (1) Israelites who ate pulse and drank water versus (2) Israelites who ate the king’s meat and drank his wine.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Describe the Data\n\nWhen we describe data, we use any tools appropriate to the situation. This can include creating graphs or calculating summary statistics to help understand or visualize the data.\nFor Daniel’s experiment, the data are described in Daniel 1:15: And at the end of ten days [the] countenances [of those who ate pulse] appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Make Inferences\n\nInference is the process of using the information contained in a sample from a population to make a general statement (i.e. to infer something) about the entire population. Later in the course we will learn techniques that make this type of analysis possible.\nMelzar made an inference. Based on the results of the sample, he determined that (in general) those who eat pulse and drink water will be healthier than those who eat the king’s meat and drink his wine Daniel 1:15-16.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Take Action\n\nThe goal of a statistical analysis is to determine which action to take in a particular situation. Actions can include many things: launching an internet ad campaign (or not), expressing gratitude (or not), getting vaccinated (or not), etc.\nMelzar took action as described in Daniel 1:16: Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave [all the Israelite children] pulse.\nWas the experiment a success?\n“Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in… the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm” Daniel 1:18-20.\n\n\n\nSummary of the Statistical Process\n\nDaniel’s experience can also help you learn the Statistical Process. Look at the first letter of each of the steps in the Statistical Process. You can use the phrase “Daniel Can Discern More Truth” to help you to help you remember the five steps in the Statistical Process.\n\nThe Statistical Process\n\n\n\n\n \nPneumonic\nActual Process Step\n\n\n\n\nStep 1:\nDaniel\nDesign the study\n\n\nStep 2:\nCan\nCollect data\n\n\nStep 3:\nDiscern\nDescribe the data\n\n\nStep 4:\nMore\nMake inferences\n\n\nStep 5:\nTruth\nTake action\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Process will be used throughout the course. Take time to memorize the five steps.\n\n\nThe study designed by the Old Testament prophet Daniel provides an ancient example of a designed experiment. Daniel’s experiment included two groups of people: those who had the experimental treatment eating pulse and drinking water (called the treatment group) and those who ate the standard food the king’s meat (called the control group.) The treatment group receives the experimental procedure. The control group is used for comparison.\n\nAnswer the following question:\n\n\n\nWhy was it important that Daniel’s experiment included a control group?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nIf there was no control group, then there would be no way to compare the effect of the diets (the treatments). Having a control group allows a researcher to see the effect of not taking any action. For Daniel, the control group (who ate the king’s meat and drank his wine) provided a basis for comparing the effect of the new treatment (i.e. eating pulse and drinking water.)"

    "text": "Design of Studies\nMost research projects can be classified into one of two basic categories: observational studies or designed experiments. In an experiment, researchers control (to some extent) the conditions under which measurements are made. In an observational study, researchers simply observe what happens, without controlling the conditions under which measurements are made. Both types of study follow the five steps of the Statistical Process.\n\n\nDesigned Experiments\nIn a designed experiment, researchers manipulate the conditions that the participants experience. They often do this by randomly assigning subjects to one of two groups, a “treatment” group (sometimes called the experimental group) and a “control” group (though this could be second treatment group instead of a control group). The experiment is typically conducted by applying some kind of treatment to the subjects in the treatment group and observing the effect of the treatment. Those in the control group do not receive the treatment and are also observed. In this way researchers can determine the effects of the treatment by comparing the treatment group results to the control group results. The following example illustrates the use of these two groups.\nJonas Salk’s First Polio Vaccine Trial\nBeginning around 1916 and through the 1950s, a mysterious plague attacked infants and children. Symptoms included excruciating muscle pain and a stiff neck. This illness, which became known as poliomyelitis or simply “polio,” left children disfigured, paralyzed, and sometimes even dead.\nWhile working as a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Dr. Jonas E. Salk developed a vaccine that might help prevent the spread of this disease. He conducted what has become one of the most famous designed experiments in history.\nThis short video below provides a compelling summary of the famous Jonas Salk vaccine experiment. As you watch, notice each of the 5 steps of a statistical study in this study.  \nAs explained in the video, in the first Salk trial almost 1.1 million children participated in the study. Even though the sample size was large, flaws in the study design rendered the results useless.\nUndaunted, Dr. Salk fixed the problems with the design and enrolled hundreds of thousands of additional children for the second phase of his study. In all, over 1.8 million infants and children participated in this experiment, making it the largest drug trial to date.\n\nStep 1: Design the study.\nThe participants in a study are commonly called subjects. Sometimes subjects are called experimental units or simply units. In the Salk trials, the children who participated were the subjects.\nSubjects (the children) were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group was given the experimental vaccine, the treatment. The treatment is the new or experimental condition that is imposed on the subjects. The subjects who receive the treatment make up the treatment group.\nThe second group was given a control or placebo. In this study, the control was an injection that looked just like the vaccine, but contained a harmless saline solution. The control group or placebo group is made up of the subjects assigned to receive the control.\nThis study was double blind. Neither the children’s parents nor their doctors knew whether a particular child received the treatment or the control. Both parties were blinded to this information.\nBecause the children were assigned to the groups randomly, the two groups should be similar. If the vaccine is not effective, the number of future cases of polio should be about the same in each group. However, if Salk’s vaccine helped to prevent the spread of polio, then fewer cases should occur in the vaccinated group.\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\nSome children can be identified as having a higher risk of developing polio. Would it have been better if they were assigned to the treatment group so they could get the vaccine?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nNo. The two groups need to be as similar as possible. Specifically, the people in the treatment group need to have the same potential (on average) of contracting polio as the people in the control group. If we put the people who are at a higher risk of developing polio in the treatment group, we run the risk of having more people in the treatment group getting polio simply because they are more likely to get it, whether they are vaccinated or not. Likewise, we might have fewer people in the control group getting polio just because they are less likely to get it, whether they are vaccinated or not.\nThese two effects would create a bias against the vaccine, by making the vaccine look like it doesn’t work, or doesn’t work as well as it does. It might also make it appear that people who aren’t vaccinated stay healthy and the vaccine is not needed. There is even a chance that people will conclude that the vaccine actually gives people polio.\nRandomly assigning subjects to the two groups tends to yield groups with similar characteristics—in this example, similar potential for contracting polio. Randomly assigning subjects to groups therefore defends us against problems like those mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\n\n\nWhy is it important for the subject and those who assess the health of the subject to be unaware of whether or not that child received the vaccine?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nSubjects: Suppose a subject in the study thinks they’re being treated. It has been documented that subjects with such knowledge tend to show improvement whether they are receiving the treatment or not. To see why, consider how you might feel and act if you were told you had been vaccinated. You might have a more hopeful outlook, leading to healthier living habits such as better hygiene and nutrition. Such changes would tend to reduce your chance of contracting polio whether you’ve received the vaccine or not. This might make the vaccine look like it works better than it does. It also might make the vaccine look like it works, even if it doesn’t.\nNow suppose subjects in the control group know they are not being treated. This can also change the way they feel and act, in ways that can make them more likely to contract polio than they would be if they weren’t in the study. This could make it look like the incidence of polio among unvaccinated persons is higher than it is, again making the vaccine look like it works better than it does.\nTo reduce bias caused by such errors, subjects should not know to which group they are assigned.\nResearchers: Suppose a researcher assessing the health of a subject is told that the subject is in the control group. It has been documented that in such a case, the researcher is more likely to record that the subject has symptoms even if the subject is not actually in the control group. This makes it look like unvaccinated persons are more likely to get polio than they really are, which makes it look like the vaccine works better than it does.\nThere are other effects of knowing to which group the subject belongs, such as doctors treating or advising the patient differently than they would without such knowledge. Such differences can make it harder to tell whether the vaccine works, and how well.\nTo reduce bias caused by such effects, those assessing the health of the subjects should not be told to which group the subject belongs.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Collect data.\nThe researchers followed up with each child to determine if they contracted polio. They recorded the number of children in each group that developed polio during the study period. Not all of Salk’s experiments were double-blind. Here is a summary of the results from the regions where a double-blind study was conducted (Francis et al., 1955; Brownlee, 1955):\n\n\nChildren Who Developed Polio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Group\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n200,688\n\n\n\n\n200,745\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacebo Group\n\n\n\n\n142\n\n\n\n\n201,087\n\n\n\n\n201,229\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Describe the data.\nOne way to summarize the data is to compute the proportion of children in each group that developed polio. The proportion of children in the treatment group that developed polio during the study period is:\n\\[ \\frac{57}{200745} = 0.000~283~9 \\]\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\nCalculate the proportion of children in the placebo group that developed polio during the study period.\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\\[ \\displaystyle{\\frac{142}{201229} = 0.000~705~7} \\]\n\n\n\nCompare the two proportions. What do you observe?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe proportion of children in the placebo group that develop polio during the study period was more than double the proportion of children in the treatment group that developed polio during the study period. That suggests that the treatment is effective in reducing the proportion of children that will develop polio.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Make inferences\nCareful statistical analysis of the records suggested that this difference was so great that it was attributable to the vaccine and not to chance. Assuming that the vaccine had no effect, the probability that the difference in the proportions between the two groups would be at least as extreme as the difference Dr. Salk observed was very low: 0.00000000093. Because this probability is so small, it is highly unlikely that these results are due to chance.\n\n\nStep 5: Take action\nOnce it was clear that the vaccine was effective, children who were unvaccinated or had received the placebo were given Salk’s vaccine. Since 1954, there has been a marked decrease in the number of polio cases worldwide (Offit, 2005). Public health researchers are striving to eradicate this disease entirely.\n\n\n\nObservational Studies\nIn an observational study researchers observe the responses of the individuals, without controlling the conditions experienced by the individuals. Therefore, they do not assign the participants to treatment or control groups.\nObservational studies commonly occur in business settings. One example is a financial audit. The purpose of a financial audit is to assess the accuracy of a company’s financial business practices. ImmunAvance Ltd., a non-government health care organization, hired the Accounting Office at Global Optimization Unlimited to perform an independent audit of their financial practices. ImmunAvance provides inoculation and other preventative health care services in rural African communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling Methods\nStep 2: Collect data\nThere are several procedures that can be used to select a random sample from a population, including: simple random sampling (SRS), stratified sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling, , and convenience sampling (or, haphazard sampling). These are examples of sampling methods.\n\nRandom Sampling Methods\nA simple random sample (SRS) is the best method for obtaining a sample from a population. This method allows each possible sample of a certain size an equal chance at being selected as the chosen sample. A difficulty of this method is that a list of all of the items in the population must be accessible before the sample is taken. Often, we obtain a SRS by allowing a computer to randomly select a certain number of items from the full list of the population. It is akin to the idea of putting all of the names into a hat, shaking them up, and randomly drawing out a few.\n\nFor example, suppose there are 18,000 students in the population of a certain university. School officials can use a computer to randomly choose values between 1 and 18,000 to identify which students are to be selected to complete a survey. In Excel, the command to obtain a random number between 1 and 18,000 is sample(1:18000, 1). A simple random sample can be obtained any time there is a complete list of the items to be sampled and they are all accessible. All the statistical procedures in this course assume that simple random sampling has been used. But in practice, the SRS is often difficult (or impossible) to implement.\n\nA stratified sample is when the items to be sampled are organized in groups of homogeneous (similar) items called strata, then a simple random sample is drawn from each of these strata. Stratified sampling works well when the items are similar within each stratum and tend to differ from one stratum to another. We often use stratified sampling in order to obtain a sample in such a way that we can make comparisons between each of the groups (or strata).\n\nFor example, in obtaining a sample of students from a university, school officials could define the strata as: (1) freshman, (2) sophomores, (3) juniors, and (4) seniors. A simple random sample could then be obtained from each of these strata. This would ensure that each class rank of students was represented in the sample. It would also allow the school officials to see how freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior level students compared in their answers to a survey.\n\nA systematic sample is where every \\(k^{\\text{th}}\\) item in the population is selected to be part of the sample, beginning at a random starting point. Systematic sampling works well when the items are in a random, but sequential ordering. If the items are not arranged randomly, a systematic sample can miss important parts of the population.\n\nFor example, consider a fast food company where every 10th customer is given the opportunity to compete a satisfaction survey in exchange for a small discount coupon towards their next purchase. An airport security line also often implements a procedure where every 100th (or so) person is selected for a more “in depth” security examination. Similarly, factories that use assembly lines will pull say every 500th item from the assembly line to perform a quality control check on the item.\n\nA cluster sample (sometimes called a block sample) consists of taking all items in one or more randomly selected clusters, or blocks. When the variation from one block to another is relatively low, compared to the variation within the block, cluster sampling is a reasonable way to get a sample.\n\nFor example, ecologists could draw grids on a map of a forest to create small sampling regions, or sampling clusters. Then, by randomly selecting one or two of these clusters from the map, the ecologists could go to the areas marked on the map and document information on the health of every tree they find in those clusters. This is a practical way to get a sample in this case because the ecologists only have to go to a few areas of the forest, but are still able to obtain a random sample of all of the trees in the forest. It is also worth noting that the ecologists would not be interesting in comparing the health of the trees from the selected clusters to each other like they would in a stratified sample. Instead, they are just looking for a feasible way to obtain a single random sample of all of the trees in the forest, but want to keep their traveling time to a minimum while collecting their sample. In contrast, to obtain a simple random sample of trees from the same forest, the ecologists would first have to go out and number every tree in the entire forest. Then they would need to use a computer to randomly pick which trees to collect data on. Finally, they would then have to go back to the forest and collect data on the selected trees from across the entire forest. Such an approach just isn’t feasible in practice, so we are willing to settle instead for the cluster sample.\n\nA convenience sample involves selecting items that are relatively easy to obtain and does not use random selection to choose the sample. This method of sampling can be assumed to always bring bias into the sample.\n\nAs an example of a convenience sample, an auditor could haphazardly select items from a filing cabinet. This is frequently done when a quick and simple sample is needed, but may not yield a sample that represents the population well. When possible, convenience samples should be avoided.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Data\nWhenever we collect data, we record information about the things we are studying. There are two basic types of data that can be recorded: quantitative measurements and categorical labels. We will call these types of data simply “quantitative” or “categorical” variables. We use the word “variable” to denote the idea that the quantitative measurements or categorical labels can vary from person to person, or item to item, in our study.\nQuantitative variables provide measurement information on each individual (or item) in our study. They represent things that are numeric in nature; things that are measured. They often include units of measurement along with the quantitative value of the measurement. For example, the heights of children measured in inches (or centimeters), or their weight measured in pounds (or kilograms). For a quantitative variable, it makes sense to apply arithmetic operations to the data (such as adding values together, computing the average of the values, or comparing two values). If one child weighs 30 pounds (13.61 kg) and a second child weights 60 pounds (27.22) then the second child is twice as heavy as the first.\nCategorical variables allow us to place each individual (or item) into to a specific category. Categorical variables are labels, and it does not make sense to do arithmetic with them. For example the gender of a newborn child, the ethnicity of an individual, a person’s job title, the brand of phone they own, or the area code of a telephone number, etc are all categorical variables. Notice that although a telephone number consists of numbers, it is not a quantitative measurement. It does not make sense to double someone’s phone number, to average phone numbers together, or to say one phone number is half the size of another. But the area code of the phone number gives information about the region where the phone number was first initiated, which is categorical information.\nNOTE: We often refer to the list of distinct category names in a categorical variable as “levels”.\nReturning to the sample accounts receivable record, we find this data to have information on both types of variables.\n\nAnswer the following question:\n\n\n\nFor each of the following variables taken from this accounts receivable record, indicate whether the variable is quantitative or categorical.\n\n\nTerms\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe variable “Terms” is categorical. It classifies the invoice by the terms of payment for that invoice.\n\n\n\nAccount number\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe variable “Account number” is categorical. Even though the account number is given a number, it is actually functioning as a label. It is not something that is counted or measured. It does not make sense to do arithmetic operations (like adding 1 or multiplying by 2) to the account number.\n\n\n\nInvoice amount\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe variable “Invoice amount” is quantitative. It makes sense to do arithmetic operations to this value. For example, the amount of Invoice 5745 (which is $990.00) is somewhat more than twice as much as that of Invoice 2378 (which is $478.00).\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 3: Describe the data\nAfter auditors collect a sample and compile the data, they review the evidence. Auditors may use graphs or compute numbers (such as the average) to summarize the evidence they found."

    "text": "Making Inferences: Hypothesis Testing\nStep 4: Make inferences\nAuditors use the information drawn from the sample to form an opinion about the population. Whenever sample data is used to infer a characteristic of a population, it is called making an inference. Inferential statistics represents a collection of methods that can be used to make inference about a population. Based on the documents reviewed, the auditors assess if the company is conducting its business in a proper manner.\nWhen conducting an audit, the implicit assumption is that transactions have been posted properly. As auditors sample the company’s records, they are looking to see if everything is consistent with the original assumption that all transactions have been posted properly. It would only be in the case of discovering suspicious activity or evidence of fraudulent reporting that the auditors would change their belief about the company and accuse the company ImmunAvance of falsely reporting on their financial statements.\n\n“Piled Higher and Deeper” by Jorge Cham  \n\nThere is a formal procedure for determining when enough evidence has been found to make accusations of fraud. Later this semester, after we establish some foundational principles of statistics, we will study these statistical methods in depth. Of course, these methods can be used for much more than just determining if a company has reported their financial statements fraudulently. So we will look at many different ways these statistical procedures can be applied to research and industry.\nFor ImmunAvance’s audit, based on the samples of financial statements that had been selected, while there were a few errors in the documents, there was not evidence dramatic enough to claim that the company had been fraudulent. So the company passed their audit.\n\nStep 5: Take Action\nThe auditors prepare a report in which they give their opinion on the status of the company’s current operations.\nSince there was not enough evidence to suggest that ImmunAvance’s financial statements were fraudulent, the auditor’s conclusion is that no adjustment is necessary. The few observed discrepancies were apparently just the result of random chance errors, not the deliberate falsefying of information."

    "text": "Summary\n\nRemember…\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Process has five steps: Design the study, Collect the data, Describe the data, Make inference, Take action. These can be remembered by the pneumonic “Daniel Can Discern More Truth.”\nIn a designed experiment, researchers control the conditions of the study, typically with a treatment group and a control group, and then observe how the treatments impact the subjects. In a purely observational study, researchers don’t control the conditions but only observe what happens.\nThe population is the entire group of all possible subjects that could be included in the study. The sample is the subset of the population that is actually selected to participate in the study. Statistics use information from the sample to make claims about what is true about the entire population.\nThere are many sampling methods used to obtain a sample from a population. The best methods use some sort of randomness (like pulling names out of a hat, rolling dice, flipping coins, or using a computer generated list of random numbers) to avoid bias.\n\n\nA simple random sample (SRS) is a random sample taken from the full list of the population. This is the least biased (best) sampling method, but can only be implemented when a full list of the population is accessible.\nA stratified sample divides the population into similar groups and then takes an SRS from each group. The main reason to use this sampling method is when a study wants to compare and contrast certain groups within the population, say to compare freshman, sophomores, juniors, and seniors at a university.\nA systematic sample samples every kth item in the population, beginning at a random starting point. This is best applied when subjects are lined up in some way, like at a fast food restaurant, an airport security line, or an assembly line in a factory.\nA cluster sample consists of taking all items in one or more randomly selected clusters, or blocks. For example, ecologists could draw grids on a map of a forest to create small sampling regions and then sample all trees they find in a few randomly selected regions. Note that this differs from a stratified sample in that only a few sub-groups (clusters) are selected and that all subjects within the selected clusters are included in the study.\nA convenience sample involves selecting items that are relatively easy to obtain and does not use random selection to choose the sample. This method of sampling can be assumed to always bring bias into the sample.\n\n\nThe best way to avoid bias when trying to make conclusions about a population from a single sample of that population is to use a random sampling method to obtain the sample.\nQuantitative variables represent things that are numeric in nature, such as the value of a car or the number of students in a classroom. Categorical variables represent non-numerical data that can only be considered as labels, such as colors or brands of shoes."

You can access the Help Desk at any time in three ways: - Walk-in: The Help Desk is located in room 322 of the McKay Library - Call in: 208-496-1411 (toll free) - Email: helpdesk@byui.edu Additional information is available at the Help Desk web page: http://www.byui.edu/helpdesk/\nWhen you have technical problems with I-Learn, you should first try contacting the Help Desk before you contact your instructor. They are connected with the IT support staff who can resolve problems with I-Learn. Please take a moment now to look at the Help Desk web page. That way, if a problem does arise later on in the course, you will know where to go for help.\nTutoring Center\nThe BYU-Idaho Study Skills/Tutoring Center is a powerful resource for students who would like a little extra help with a course. The Tutoring Center is located in the McKay Library in room 272. This is in the east wing of the second floor.\nThe Tutoring Center provides many services to help students succeed: - Individual tutors - Walk-in tutoring in the Math Study Center (McKay 266 & 270) - Virtual tutoring\nPlease take 5 minutes to explore the Study Skills/Tutoring Center web site.\nData Science Lab\nThere is a Data Science Lab open for walk-ins. They are able to help with any R-related questions and programming, but you are also likely to find someone who has taken stats classes and can help you with the statistics as well.\nLocation and hours can be found at the link. It is usually in the STC 353, on most days but Wednesday.\nFaculty Support\nYour instructor is committed to your success. If you have any needs or concerns, please contact your instructor for help. If you feel yourself getting behind or struggling, talk to your teacher right away. If caught in time, a small problem can be addressed quickly before it grows."

R is like the engine in a car, and RStudio is the driver’s controls. We don’t need to know the guts of a combustion engine to drive, and we don’t need to know what’s going on in R, but we do need it on our computer.\nTo install R and RStudio on your computer, please follow these instructions:\n\nGo to the R-Studio page and follow the instructions:\na. Install R. The “Download and Install R” button will take you to the R website. You will have to click through a few links to get to the download.\n\nFor PC: “Download R for Windows” &gt; “Install R for the first time” &gt; Whatever the latest version is will be at the top.\n\nFor Mac: “Download R for Mac” &gt; There will be 2 options on the left with the latest version of R (R-4.4.3, for example). Which version you download depends on what kind of processor chip you have, but most will work with the version ending in “arm64.pkg”\n\nReturn to the R-studio download page and click the “Download RStudio Desktop” button. Run the downloaded program and accept the defaults.\n\nOnce the RStudio installer downloads, open the resulting file.\nClick “Continue” or “Okay” or “Accept” for all of the several various windows that will appear.\nOnce the installation finishes you can use your computer’s search bar to search for “RStudio” in your apps.\n\n\nNOTE: If you are using a Chromebook or other “web browsing only” computer that will not allow you to install software locally, then set up an account at RStudio Cloud instead of installing R and RStudio as shown above.

This is like going to the Home Depot to buy a specialized toolbox and then storing it in your garage. We only have to “buy” it once.\nWe will be using 4 main libraries throughout the semester. This code will walk you through how to install, load and use each of the libraries.\n\n\nInstalling Libraries\nTo install a library, we use the install.packages(\"\") command, where we specify the library we want in the quotes inside the parentheses.\nThis is something we only have to do once for each library. The 4 main libraries we will use in the class are the tidyverse, mosaic, rio, and car libraries.\nRun the code below by clicking the green arrow at the top right of the code chunk.\nYou can also run individual lines inside of a code chunk by pressing:\n\nPC: ctrl + Enter\nMac: CMD + Enter\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"rio\")\ninstall.packages(\"mosaic\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"car\")\n\nIt may take a few minutes to install everything once you run the above code. Be patient.\nAgain, the above code only needs to be executed once. It is like going to the Home Depot to purchase a tool box for specific purposes and storing them in a tool shed.\n\n\nLoading Libraries\nOnce the toolboxes are “purchased” we still need to get them out of the tool shed when we need to use them. This is something we have to do each time we open and use R Studio for a project.\nWe use the library() function in a code chunk and insert which library we want to use inside the parentheses:\n\nlibrary(rio)\nlibrary(mosaic)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(car)\n\nThe above code chunk is something that will become very familiar as we will load these libraries in every activity.\nEach of the above libraries has special tools for doing managing data, creating graphs, data summarization, etc. that we will learn as we go. While we won’t use all of them in each assignment, it is easier to get in the habit of loading them all for each activity.\n\nrio is useful for loading in data of different types using a single function, import()\nmosaic has many data summarization tools\ntidyverse has a vast range of tools that make it easy to wrangle and visualize data\ncar is a little more specific and is used in this class to do one specific type of chart later in the semester.\n\nNOTE: While you only have to install libraries once, you have to load them every time you want to use one. It’s like going to the garage to get the toolbox you need for the job.\n\n\nTesting, Testing\nAfter running the code chunks above, run the code below to verify that you can read in a dataset and make data summaries:\nUse the import() function to load the dataset by running the following code chunk:\n\nwrong_site &lt;- import(\"https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Course/raw/main/Data/WrongSiteWrongPatient.xlsx\") %&gt;% tibble()\n\nwrong_site\n\n# A tibble: 411 × 3\n   Wrong_Site Wrong_Patient Comments                                            \n        &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                               \n 1      97465        250000 On rare occasions, a medical procedure is performed…\n 2      36141        106900 or on the wrong patient.

Each column contains one specific type of data across all the observations. For example, in the same student dataset, there could be a column for “Name,” a column for “Age,” and another for “Grade.”\nNOTE: Column names in a dataset are considered variables.\nTogether, rows and columns provide a structured format that makes it easy to organize, analyze, and visualize the data.\n\nData Types (Review)\nIn this class, we will use the broad categories of “quantitative” and “categorical” variables to distinguish between numerical values and data that represent group information respectively. As we will see below, it’s not always as easy as it seems to tell the difference.\n\n\nQuantitative Variables\nVariables that are quantitative consists of values that represent measurable quantities.\n\n\nCategroical Variables\nCategorical data consists of values that represent categories or groups. We refer to each of the categories as “levels” of the variable.\nTo see all of the levels of a categorical variable, we can use the unique() function.

    "text": "Percentiles and Quartiles\nA percentile is a number such that a specified percentage of the data are at or below this number. For example, the 99th percentile is a number such that 99% of the data are at or below this value. As another example, half (50%) of the data lie at or below the 50th percentile. The word percent means \\(\\div 100\\). This can help you remember that the percentiles divide the data into 100 equal groups.\nQuartiles are special percentiles. The word quartile is from the Latin quartus, which means “fourth.” The quartiles divide the data into four equal groups. The quartiles correspond to specific percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the 25th percentile. The second quartile, Q2, is the same as the 50th percentile or the median. The third quartile, Q3, is equivalent to the 75th percentile.\nNOTE: Percentiles can be used to describe the center and spread of any distribution and are particularly useful when the distribution is skewed or has outliers.\nUse R’s quantile() function to calculate percentiles. This functions requires two inputs separated by a comma: the data and the desired percentile input as a decimal.\n\nTo calculate the 25th percentile for the costs of surgery done on the Wrong Site:\n\n\nquantile(wrong_patient$Wrong_Site, .25, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n  25% \n29496 \n\n\nQUESTION: What does this number mean?\nANSWER:\nThe first quartile (\\(Q_1\\)) or 25th percentile (calculated in R) of the wrong-site data is: $29,496. (This result is illustrated in the figure below.) This means that 25 percent of the time hospitals lost a wrong-site lawsuit, they had to pay $29,496 or less. The 25th percentile can be written symbolically as: P25 = $29,496. Other percentiles can be written the same way.

    "section": "Histograms",
    "text": "Histograms\nHistograms are commonly used to visualize a single, quantitative variable. It provides a way to visualize how data points are spread out.\nThe key components of a histogram are:\n\nBars: Histograms consist of adjacent bars, where each bar represents a range of values, known as a “bin.” The height of each bar indicates the frequency (or count) of data points that fall within that bin.\nBins: The x-axis is divided into equal intervals (bins). Each bin captures a specific range of values. For example, if you’re plotting test scores, a bin might cover scores at 5-point intervals.\nFrequency: The y-axis shows the frequency or number of observations that fall within each bin. This allows you to see how many data points lie in each bin.\n\n\nHow to Interpret a Histogram:\n\nShape of Distribution: The overall shape of the histogram can indicate the distribution of the data.\nCentral Tendency: You can often observe where most of the data points cluster, giving an idea of the central tendency (mean, median).\nSpread: You can see how spread out the data is, which provides insights into variability.\nOutliers: Histograms can help identify any potential outliers by showing bars with significantly lower frequencies compared to others.\n\n\n\nDescribing the “Shape” of a Distribution\nWe will describe the shape of the distribution of a data set using the following basic categories:\n\nSymmetric (bell-shaped)\n\nRight skewed\n\nLeft skewed\n\nA distribution is symmetric if both the left and right side of the distribution appear to be roughly a mirror image of each other. A special symmetric distribution is a bell-shaped distribution. When data follow a bell-shaped distribution, the histogram looks like a bell. Bell-shaped distributions play an important role in Statistics and will play a role in most of the future lessons.\nA distribution is right-skewed if a histogram of the distribution shows a long right tail. This can occur if there are some very large outliers on the right-hand side of the distribution. A distribution is left-skewed if a histogram shows that it has a long tail to the left.\n\n\n\nRight-skewed\n\n\nSymmetric & Bell-shaped\n\n\nLeft-skewed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean: $10.45\nMedian: $9.04\nMean is to the right of the median.\n\n\nMean: 71.1 inches\nMedian: 71 inches\nMean and median are roughly equal.\n\n\nMean: 3.42\nMedian: 3.45\nMean is to the left of the median.\n\n\n\n\nIf a distribution has only one peak, it is said to be unimodal. The three distributions illustrated above are all unimodal distributions. Some people might argue that there are several peaks in the GPA data, so it should not be considered unimodal. Even though there are jagged bumps in the histogram, it is important to visualize the overall shape in the data. When interpreting a histogram, it can be helpful to blur your eyes and imagine the overall shape after smoothing out the bumps. If the overall trend indicates that there is more than one bump, then we do not consider the distribution to be unimodal. We will usually only work with unimodal data sets in this course.\nSome distributions have no distinct peak, others have more than one peak. When there is no distinct peak, and the histogram shows a relatively flat shape, we might say the data follow a uniform distribution. If there are two distinct peaks, a distribution is called bimodal. If there are more than two peaks, we refer to the distribution as multimodal."

So the 20th percentile would be written as 0.2.\nA percentile is a number such that a specified percentage of the data are at or below this number. For example, if say 80% of college students were shorter than (or equal to) 70 inches tall in height, then the 80th percentile of heights of college students would be 70 inches.\nStandard deviation is calculated in R for a sample of data using sd(data).\nThe standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the data typically are from the mean of that data. A larger standard deviation means the data are more spread out from their mean than data with a smaller standard deviation. The standard deviation is never negative. A standard deviation of zero implies all values in the data set are exactly the same.\nTo compute any of the five-number summary values in R, use the R function favstats(data) which also includes the mean and standard deviation.\nThe five-number summary consists of (1) the minimum value in the data, (2) the first quartile (25th percentile) of the data, (3) the median of the data (50th percentile), (4) the third quartile (75th percentile) of the data, and (5) the maximum value occurring in the data.\nTo create a boxplot in R, use the boxplot(data) or for multiple columns boxplot(data1, data2, names=c(\"Name of Column 1\", \"Name of Column 2)).\nBoxplots are a visualization of the five-number summary of a data set."

These elements are:\n\nData layer\nAesthetic mappings\nGeometry layers\n\nThe data layer identifies the data we wish to express visually.\nThe Aesthetic Mapping is a description of how we map specific data elements to specific chart elements. For example, what variable in the data do we want expressed on the X axis or Y axis. We can also map a data variable to the color element.\nLastly, the Geometry Layer tells the computer how to express those Aesthetic Mappings, such as a scatter plot, boxplot, bar chart, etc.\nAs in English, we can make more complex sentences with other graphical elements, but the three mentioned above will be common to all.\nThis sounds more complicated than it is in practice.

When dealing with multiple groups, you may want to split the graph into several panels, one for each group.\nFacets allow us to split a graph up based on a variable in the data. For example, if we wanted a separate regression plot for each species, we could “add” a facet:\n\nggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(~Species) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sepal Length\",\n    y = \"Sepal Width\",\n    title = \"Comparing Sepal Length and Sepal Width by Species\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the x-axes are the same for each group by default. That is often how we want to visualize data. Sometimes, though, we want to have each graph only cover the range of the data. We can allow the x and y axes to accommodate different ranges of data by setting the “scales” parameter inside the facet_grid to “free”:\n\nggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(~Species, scales = \"free\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sepal Length\",\n    y = \"Sepal Width\",\n    title = \"Comparing Sepal Length and Sepal Width by Species\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: When we want to “add” something to a graph, we simply include a + and tell it what we want to add.

    "text": "Histograms and Density Plots\nHistograms are typically used When we want to look at the distribution of a single variable. Because this is a single variable, we only define an x without a y.\n\nggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Sepal Length\",\n    x = \"Sepal Length\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# We can modify the number of bins in a histogram:  Play around with the \"bin\" Parameter\n\nggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Sepal Length\",\n    x = \"Sepal Length\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above histogram includes data from all species. We can distinguish species in several ways. One is to color the bars by species. Compare the difference between “color=Species” and “fill=Species” inside the aesthetic.\nWARNING: Would not recommend:\n\nggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill=Species)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Sepal Length\",\n    x = \"Sepal Length\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not usually a good idea to layer histograms like this because it can obscure what is happening behind the covered layers. This is a situation where faceting can be useful.\nRecall that by default the x-axis will be fixed to the same values for each facet. We can let the x axis scale be different for each group by including scales = \"free\" into the facet_grid argument as above.\nTry both and see which tells a more compelling story:\n\nggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 10) +\n  facet_grid(~Species) +\n  #facet_grid(~Species, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Sepal Length\",\n    x = \"Sepal Length\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Better Histogram\nWhile histograms are a fine way to express the distribution of quantitative variables, it is not the only way. A Density plot is a smooth version of a histogram. Density plots use data to calculate a smooth line that expresses the quantitative variable as a continuous value rather than using crude bins.\nBy making the smooth line, it is much easier to compare between groups on the same plot:\n\nggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n  geom_density(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Sepal Length\",\n    x = \"Sepal Length\"\n  )"

Adding na.rm=TRUE to your functions will make sure that you get a mean value.\nEXAMPLE: Let’s do the same means but for handedness:\n\nclean &lt;- survey %&gt;%\n  group_by(Handed) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    mean_height = mean(Height_cm, na.rm=TRUE),\n    mean_react_time = mean(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),\n    mean_social_media_hrs = mean(Social_Websites_Hours, na.rm=TRUE)\n  )\n\nclean\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  Handed       mean_height mean_react_time mean_social_media_hrs\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Ambidextrous        255.           0.352                  20.2\n2 Left-Handed         164.           1.45                   14.5\n3 Right-Handed        167.           0.583                  13.9\n\n\n\nCombining Tidy Functions\n\n\n\nClick to see how to filter outliers for reaction times (reaction times greater than 1 second), and height outliers (taller than 7 feet tall), and social media hours (more than 100 hours).\n\n\n\nClick to see\n\n\nclean &lt;- survey %&gt;%\n  filter(Height_cm &lt; 214,\n         Reaction_time &lt; 1,\n         Social_Websites_Hours &lt; 100) %&gt;%\n  select(Gender, Height_cm, Reaction_time, Social_Websites_Hours)\n\n# Pipe the new clean dataset into the group_by() and summarise() as above:\n\nclean %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    mean_height = mean(Height_cm, na.rm=TRUE),\n    sd_ht = sd(Height_cm, na.rm=TRUE),\n    mean_react_time = mean(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),\n    sd_react_time = sd(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),\n    mean_social_media_hrs = mean(Social_Websites_Hours, na.rm=TRUE),\n    sd_social_hrs = sd(Social_Websites_Hours, na.rm=TRUE)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  Gender mean_height sd_ht mean_react_time sd_react_time mean_social_media_hrs\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Female        158.  25.1           0.444         0.134                  12.9\n2 Male          174.  23.4           0.395         0.139                  12.5\n# ℹ 1 more variable: sd_social_hrs &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrouping by Multiple Variables\nIt is simple to get summary statistics for multiple grouping factors.\nEXAMPLE: Suppose we want the same means calculated above, but for gender and handedness:\n\nclean &lt;- survey %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender, Handed) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    mean_height = mean(Height_cm, na.rm=TRUE),\n    mean_react_time = mean(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),\n    mean_social_media_hrs = mean(Social_Websites_Hours, na.rm=TRUE)\n  )\n\nclean\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n# Groups:   Gender [2]\n  Gender Handed       mean_height mean_react_time mean_social_media_hrs\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Female Ambidextrous        134.           0.361                  27  \n2 Female Left-Handed         160.           0.524                  12.8\n3 Female Right-Handed        159.           0.750                  14.3\n4 Male   Ambidextrous        315.           0.348                  16.8\n5 Male   Left-Handed         167.           2.29                   16.1\n6 Male   Right-Handed        175.           0.420                  13.5\n\n\nI can also use the n() function without any inputs to count the number of observations in each group:\n\nclean &lt;- survey %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender, Handed) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    mean_height = mean(Height_cm, na.rm=TRUE),\n    mean_react_time = mean(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),\n    mean_social_media_hrs = mean(Social_Websites_Hours, na.rm=TRUE),\n    N = n()\n  )\n\nclean\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n# Groups:   Gender [2]\n  Gender Handed       mean_height mean_react_time mean_social_media_hrs     N\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 Female Ambidextrous        134.           0.361                  27       3\n2 Female Left-Handed         160.           0.524                  12.8    17\n3 Female Right-Handed        159.           0.750                  14.3   132\n4 Male   Ambidextrous        315.           0.348                  16.8     6\n5 Male   Left-Handed         167.           2.29                   16.1    19\n6 Male   Right-Handed        175.           0.420                  13.5   135\n\n\nThis shows me that there are only 3 female ambidextrous students in the sample and 6 male ambidextrous students."

Inside the parentheses, give the new column a name and set it equal to what you want that column to be.\nEXAMPLE: It is widely known that arm span is typically very close to one’s height. Let’s create a column of the ratio of Height (Height_cm) to armspan (Armspan_cm) and call the new column, ht_to_span. If common knowledge is correct, we would expect the ratio to be close to 1 on average.\n\nclean &lt;- survey %&gt;%\n  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm)\n\nmean(clean$ht_to_span)\n\n[1] Inf\n\n\nNotice that the mean is Inf which means infinity, or undefined. This is likely due to R attempting to divide a number by zero, meaning someone answered that their arm span was zero. This is where filter() comes in handy. We can filter out the rows where Armspan_cm is 0:\n\nclean &lt;- survey %&gt;%\n  filter(Armspan_cm &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm)\n\nhistogram(clean$ht_to_span, xlab = \"Height / Armspan\", main = \"Distribution of Height to Armspan Ratio\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine someone who is 40 times taller than his or her arm span.

    "text": "Normal Distributions and Normal Computations\n\nBaseball Batting Averages\n\nIn baseball, a player called the “pitcher” throws a ball to a player called the “batter.” The batter swings a wooden or metal bat and tries to hit the ball. A “hit” is made when the batter successfully hits the ball and runs to a point in the field called first base. A player’s batting average is calculated as the ratio of the number of hits a player makes divided by the number of times the player has attempted to hit the ball or in other words, been “at bat.” Sean Lahman reported the batting averages of several professional baseball players in the United States. (Lahman, 2010) The file BattingAverages.xlsx contains his data.\nThe following histogram summarizes the batting averages for these professional baseball players:\n\nNotice the bell-shaped distribution of the data.\nSuppose we want to estimate the probability that a randomly selected player will have a batting average that is greater than 0.280. One way to do this would be to find the proportion of players in the data set who have a batting average above 0.280. We can do this by finding the number of players who fall into each of the red-colored bins below and dividing this number by the total number of players.\n\nIn other words, we could find the proportion of the total area of the bars that is shaded red out of the combined area of all the bars. This gives us the proportion of players whose batting averages are greater than 0.280.\nOut of the 446 players listed, there are a total of 133 players with batting averages over 0.280. This suggests that the proportion of players whose batting average exceeds 0.280 is:\n\\[\\displaystyle{\\frac{133}{446}} = 0.298\\]\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the data follow a bell-shaped distribution to find the probability that a player has a batting average above 0.280.\n\n\nDensity Curves\nThe bell-shaped curve superimposed on the histogram above is called a density curve. It is essentially a smooth histogram. Notice how closely this curve follows the observed data.\nThe density curve illustrated on the histogram of the batting average data is special. It is called a normal density curve. This density curve is symmetric and has a bell-shape.\nThe normal density curve is also referred to as a normal distribution or a “Gaussian” distribution (after Carl Friedrich Gauss.)\nThe normal density curve appears in many applications in business, nature, medicine, psychology, sociology, and more. We will use the normal density curve extensively in this course.\nAll density curves, including normal density curves, have two basic properties:\n\nThe total area under the curve equals 1.\nThe density curve always lies on or above the horizontal axis.\n\nBecause of these two properties, the area under the curve can be treated as a probability. If we want to find the probability that a randomly selected baseball player will have a batting average between some range of values, we only need to find the area under the curve in that range. This is illustrated by the region shaded in blue in the figure below.\n\nA normal density curve is uniquely determined by its mean, \\(\\mu\\), and its standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\). So, if random variables follow a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation, then we can calculate any probabilities related to that variable by finding the area under the curve.\nWhen the mean of a normal distribution is 0 and its standard deviation is 1, we call it the standard normal distribution.\nWe will return to this example later and will find the area shaded in blue.\n\nCharacteristics of the Normal Curve\n\nIntroduction to \\(z\\)-scores\nIn Ghana, the mean height of young adult women is normally distributed with mean \\(159.0\\) cm and standard deviation \\(4.9\\) cm. (Monden & Smits, 2009) Serwa, a female BYU-Idaho student from Ghana, is \\(169.0\\) cm tall. Her height is \\(169.0 - 159.0 = 10\\) cm greater than the mean. When compared to the standard deviation, she is about two standard deviations (\\(\\approx 2 \\times 4.9\\) cm) taller than the mean.\nThe heights of men are also normally distributed. The mean height of young adult men in Brazil is \\(173.0\\) cm (“Oramento,” 2010), and the standard deviation for the population is \\(6.3\\) cm. (Castilho & Lahr, 2001) A Brazilian BYU-Idaho student, Gustavo, is \\(182.5\\) cm tall. Compared to other Brazilians, he is taller than the mean height of Brazilian men.\n\nAnswer the following question:\n\n\n\nApproximately how many standard deviations above the mean is Gustavo’s height?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nGustavo’s height is \\(182.5 - 173.0 = 9.5 \\text{ cm  }\\) above the mean. The standard deviation of the height of Brazilian men is 6.3 cm, so his height is \\(\\displaystyle{ \\frac{9.5}{6.3} =1.508 }\\) standard deviations above the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing \\(z\\)-scores\nWhen we examined the heights of Serwa and Gustavo, we compared their height to the standard deviation. If we look carefully at the steps we did, we subtracted the mean height for people of the same gender and nationality from each individual’s height, respectively.\nThis shows how much taller or shorter the person is than the mean height. In order to compare the height difference to the standard deviation, we divide the difference by the standard deviation. This gives the number of standard deviations the individual is above or below the mean.\nFor example, Serwa’s height is 169.0 cm. If we subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation, we get \\[z = \\frac{169.0 - 159.0}{4.9} = 2.041\\] We call this number a \\(z\\)-score. The \\(z\\)-score for a data value tells how many standard deviations away from the mean the observation lies. If the \\(z\\)-score is positive, then the observed value lies above the mean. A negative \\(z\\)-score implies that the value was below the mean.\nWe compute the \\(z\\)-score for Gustavo’s height similarly, and obtain \\[z = \\frac{182.5 - 173.0}{6.3} = 1.508\\] Gustavo’s \\(z\\)-score is 1.508. As noted above, this is about one-and-a-half standard deviations above the mean. In general, if an observation \\(x\\) is taken from a random process with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), then the \\(z\\)-score is \\[z = \\frac{x -\\mu }{\\sigma}\\]\nThe \\(z\\)-score can be computed for data from any distribution, but it is most commonly applied to normally distributed data.\n\n\n68-95-99.7% Rule for Bell-shaped Distributions\nHeights of women (or men) in a particular population follow a normal distribution. Most people’s heights are close to the mean. A few are very tall or very short. We would like to make a more precise statement than this.\n\nFor any bell-shaped distribution,\n\n68% of the data will lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean,\n95% of the data will lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and\n99.7% of the data will lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean.\n\nThis is called the 68-95-99.7% Rule for Bell-shaped Distributions. Some statistics books refer to this as the Empirical Rule. \n\n\n\nApproximately 68% of the observations from a bell-shaped distribution will be between the values of \\(\\mu -~\\sigma~\\)and \\(\\mu +~\\sigma\\). Consider the heights of young adult women in Ghana. We expect that about 68% of Ghanaian women have a height between the values of \\[\\mu -~\\sigma = 159.0 - 4.9 = 154.1~\\text{cm}\\] and \\[\\mu +~\\sigma = 159.0 + 4.9 = 163.9~\\text{cm}.\\]\nSo, if a female is chosen at random from all the young adult women in Ghana, about 68% of those chosen will have a height between 154.1 and 163.9 cm. Similarly, 95% of the women’s heights will be between the values of \\[\\mu - 2\\sigma = 159.0 - 2(4.9) = 149.2~\\text{cm}\\] and \\[\\mu + 2\\sigma = 159.0 + 2(4.9) = 168.8~\\text{cm}.\\]\nFinally, 99.7% of the women’s heights will be between \\[\\mu - 3\\sigma = 159.0 - 3(4.9) = 144.3~\\text{cm}\\] and \\[\\mu + 3\\sigma = 159.0 + 3(4.9) = 173.7~\\text{cm}.\\]\n\n\n\nUnusual Events\nIf a \\(z\\)-score is extreme (either a large positive number or a large negative number), then that suggests that that observed value is very far from the mean. The 68-95-99.7% rule states that 95% of the observed data values will be within two standard deviations of the mean. This means that 5% of the observations will be more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean (either to the left or to the right).\nWe define an unusual observation to be something that happens less than 5% of the time. For normally distributed data, we determine if an observation is unusual based on its \\(z\\)-score. We call an observation unusual if \\(z &lt; -2\\) or if \\(z &gt; 2\\). In other words, we will call an event unusual if the absolute value of its \\(z\\)-score is greater than 2.\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\nOut of Serwa and Gustavo, who is physically taller?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nGustavo is taller. He is 182.5 cm tall, and Serwa is 169.0 cm tall.\n\n\n\nRelative to their own gender and nationality, who is relatively taller?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nRelative to other Ghanaian women, Serwa is very tall. Gustavo is tall relative to Brazilian men, but relative to people of his gender and nationality, he is not relatively taller than Serwa. Serwa has a higher \\(z\\)-score.\n\n\n\nAre either of these heights unusual?\n\n\n\nShow/Hide Solution\n\n\nSerwa’s height is unusual. Her \\(z\\)-score is: \\(z = 2.041\\) This is more than two standard deviations away from the mean. Gustavo’s height is not unusual. His \\(z\\)-score is less than two standard deviations away from the mean.\n\n\n\n\n“Piled Higher and Deeper” by Jorge Cham"

The pnorm(x, \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\)) function calculates areas under the curve the normal distribution with mean, \\(\\mu\\), and standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), for a given x.\nThe p in pnorm() stands for probability and norm obviously stands for the normal distribution.\nBy default, pnorm() gives the area of the curve to the LEFT of the value, \\(x\\), for a normal distribution with a mean, \\(\\mu\\), and standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\).\nWe can calculate probabilities directly in the original units of the data, or use the z-score with a \\(\\mu=0\\) and \\(\\sigma=1\\): pnorm(z).\nNOTE: pnorm() has a default value for the mean, \\(\\mu = 0\\) and standard deviation, \\(\\sigma = 1\\) so we don’t have to input those values when we use a z-score with the standard normal distribution.\n\nHeights of Ghanaian Women\nWe will use the example of Serwa’s height to find the proportion of young Ghanaian women who are shorter than Serwa. Recall that for the height of young Ghanaian women, the population mean is 159.0 cm and the population standard deviation is 4.9 cm. Serwa’s height is 169.0 cm. We found the \\(z\\)-score of Serwa’s height as:\n\\[z = \\frac{x -\\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{169.0- 159.0}{4.9} = 2.041\\]\nWhat proportion of young Ghanaian women reach a height that is at or below 169 cm? To answer this question, we need to find the area under a normal density curve (i.e. the probability) that is to the left of \\(z = 2.041\\).\nTo find the area under a normal curve corresponding to a \\(z\\)-score of \\(2.041\\), do the following:\n\npnorm(2.041)\n\n[1] 0.9793746\n\n\nWe can use the mosaic library to visualize the areas under the normal distribution:\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\nmosaic::xpnorm(169.0, mean = 159.0, sd = 4.9) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.9793655\n\n\nNOTE: The area to the left of our chosen \\(z\\)-score is also the probability that a randomly selected woman will be shorter than Serwa. The probability that a randomly selected Ghanaian woman will be shorter than Serwa is \\(0.979\\), or \\(97.9\\%\\).\n\n\nBaseball Averages\nWe now return to the example of the baseball batting averages. We want to find the probability that a randomly selected player will have a batting average that is above 0.280. The population mean is 0.261 and the population standard deviation is 0.034. We can use this information to find a \\(z\\)-score. Then we use the 1-pnorm() to find the area under the normal curve to the right of this \\(z\\)-score.\n\\[z = \\frac{x -\\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{0.280 - 0.261}{0.034} = 0.559\\]\n\nx &lt;- 0.280\nmu &lt;- 0.261\nsigma &lt;- 0.034\n\nz &lt;- (x-mu)/sigma\n\n# Area to the LEFT:\npnorm(x, mu, sigma)\n\n[1] 0.7118589\n\n## Equivilantly:\npnorm(z)\n\n[1] 0.7118589\n\n# Area to the RIGHT\n1-pnorm(x, mu, sigma)\n\n[1] 0.2881411\n\n1-pnorm(z)\n\n[1] 0.2881411\n\n\nUsing the xpnorm() in the mosaic library, type the \\(z\\)-score of \\(0.559\\). Click on the areas under the curve until only the region on the right is highlighted in purple.\nTo get xpnorm() to give the Right Tail probability, you need to specify lower.tail=FALSE:\n\nmosaic::xpnorm(0.559, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.2880809\n\n\nThe area under the curve to the right of \\(z = 0.559\\) is \\(0.2881\\). This is the probability that a randomly selected player will have a batting average that is greater than 0.280. (Note: It is a coincidence that the area, 0.288, is close to the batting average of 0.280. There is no significance in this.)\n\n\n\nFinding the Probability of Being Between Two Values\n\nHeights of Ghanaian Women\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected young Ghanaian women will be between 150.0 cm and 163.0 cm tall? Recall that the average height for young Ghanaian women is \\(\\mu=159.0\\) cm and the population standard deviation is \\(\\sigma=4.9\\) cm.\nWe want to find the probability that a randomly selected woman’s height is between \\(150.0\\) cm and \\(165.0\\) cm. To do this we find the \\(z\\)-score for both values:\n\\[z_1 = \\frac{x- \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{150.0 - 159.0}{4.9} = -1.837\\] \\[z_2 = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{165.0 -159.0}{4.9} = 1.22\\]\nWe now answer the question by finding the area under the normal density curve (i.e. the probability) to the left of \\(z = 1.22\\) which is \\(0.8888\\) and also the area under the normal density curve to the left of \\(z = -1.837\\) which is \\(0.033\\). To find the area between \\(z = 1.22\\) and \\(z = -1.837\\), we subtract the smaller area from the larger.\n\\[0.8888 - 0.0331 = 0.8557\\]\nSo the probability that the height of a randomly selected young Ghanaian woman will be between 150.0 cm and 165.0 cm is \\(0.8558\\). This is the same as the proportion of all young Ghanaian women who are between 150.0 and 165.0 cm tall.\nWe can easily get mosaic::xpnorm() to provide this for us automatically by providing a list of values between which we would like to calculate the area under the curve.\nTo find the probability of being between any 2 numbers for a normal distribution with mean, \\(\\mu\\), and standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), we can use the following R code:\n\nmosaic::xpnorm(c(150, 165), mean = 159, sd = 4.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.03312454 0.88961624\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Percentiles using a Normal Distribution\nA percentile is a number such that a specified percentage of the population are at or below this number. For example, the 25th percentile is the number in a data set that is greater than or equal to 25% of all the values in the data set.\nWe can find percentiles for a given dataset by using the quantile() function as described in the chapter on summarizing data\nHowever, to calculate percentiles from a normal distribution, we use the qnorm(percentile, mu, sigma) function.\nNOTE: R typically uses the word quantile when referring to percentiles. So the \\(q\\) in qnorm() stands for quantile.\nTo find the height of a Ghanaian woman corresponding to the 90th percentile:\n\nqnorm(.90, mean = 159, sd = 4.9)\n\n[1] 165.2796\n\n\nThe 90th percentile of the heights averages is 165.2796. That means that 90% of the Ghanaian women are shorter than 165.2796 cm tall.\nWe can also use xqnorm() in the mosaic library to visualize:\n\nmosaic::xqnorm(.9, mean=159, sd=4.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 165.2796"

For the variable \\(\\bar x\\), two standard deviations would be equal to \\(2 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\).\nANSWER: If we collect a random sample from a population and \\(\\bar x\\) is normally distributed, then about 95% of the time the sample mean \\(\\bar x\\) will be less than \\(2 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) units away from the population mean \\(\\mu\\).

In these situations, we take 2 random samples from each population and perform statistical tests to determine if the population means are significantly different. Because these two groups of individuals are sampled independently, we call this analysis Independent 2-Sample t-test.\nAlternatively, in many experimental designs, participants are randomly assigned into a treatment and a control group. The randomization process ensures that there is no association between participants in either group. They are independent.\nWhen 2 random samples are taken from 2 separate populations, or when a group of people are randomly assigned into treatment groups, the samples are independent.\nSome examples include:\n\nComparing salaries of men and women (randomly sample men and women separately)\nTesting a new medication compared to a placebo (participants randomly assigned to treatment groups)\nComparing average GPA of Math majors and Economics majors (randomly select from each population)"

This relates to the null hypothesis of the difference between the means, which we expect to be zero if the null hypothesis is true.\nWhen specifying an alternative hypothesis in R (alternative=\"\"), a reference group must be used. The reference serves as the baseline for comparison. R will assess how the mean of the second group differs from that of the first.\nBy default, R decides which group is the reference group alphabetically. Whichever category label is first alphabetically is the reference group.\nNOTE: In R, group 1 and 2 are determined alphabetically according to the labels in the explanatory variable column.\nEXAMPLE: If my explanatory variable is sex, and they are labeled “Female” and “Male”, then “Female” would be the reference group.

In 1992, the investigators gathered data on ten international matches which involved the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks. The first five games were the last international games played under the old rules, and the second set of five were the first internationals played under the new rules.\nFor each of the ten games, the data give the successive times (in seconds) of each passage of play in that game.\nYou will investigate whether the mean duration of the passages has dropped under the new rules.\nUse a level of significance of 0.01.\n\nLoad the Data\n\nrugby &lt;- import(\"https://byuistats.github.io/M221R/Data/quiz/R/nz_rugby.csv\")\n\n\n\nExplore the Data\nCreate a side-by-side boxplot for the amount of reported passage of play before and after the rule changes.\nAdd a title and change the colors of the boxes.\nWhat do you observe?\nCreate a table of summary statistics of play time for before and after the rule change.

    "text": "Introduction\nSo far in class, we have encountered only fairly clean data examples carefully managed and stored in an easy to access location. We have been able to use the import() function from the rio library with a link to a well-contained data resource.\nWhen we encounter data in the wild, it can be much more complicated to extract and clean up. However, good research should be transparent, with data sources cited and, where possible, published. We can often find links to raw data for graphs.\nFor this assignment, you will find a dataset that interests you online and submit a link to the location of the data.\nLesson Objectives:\n\nStart with a reaserch question that interests you. It can be about any topic (finance, music, video games, hunting, weather, mental health, AI…seriously anything!)\n\nUse the resources provided in this document to find a related dataset to your research question\nRefine your research question\n\n\n\nResearch Question\nFor this project, a good research question will be interesting to you AND feasible to find available data. You can certainly think of exciting research questions for which the data are impossible to find or collect. Expect to refine your research question as you begin the data search.\nOnce you have a research question in mind, start looking for data relating to it.\n\n\nFinding Data\nThere are several online resources for data searches. Below are some good places to start.\nGoogle actually has a search engine specifically for datasets\nStatista has a datasets for a wide range of topics but is particularly well suited for government policy-related data such as health, crime, social science.\nKaggle runs competitions for companies who outsource data challenges. It has also compiled a large library of datasets on a range of topics. Because businesses run competitions through here, there are a lot of datasets related to specific challenges that businesses face.\n\n\nRefining the Question\nWe are not always able to find the exact data that addressess our research question. This is a limitation of not designing your own study from scratch.\nIf you are unable to find the perfect data, refine your question.\nIt’s still a good idea to start with a question that interests you. You’re more likely to end up with a dataset that you enjoy working with.\nOnce you’ve found a dataset of interest, submit the link to the website into Canvas."
