# Introduction

Use the Star Wars dataset to answer the following questions:  

1. Do less than 20% of respondents feel Very Favorably towards Emperor Palpatine?  (1-sample Z test for proportion)
2. What is the difference in proportions of females and males who are Very Favorable towards Jar-Jar Binks? (2-sample Proportion)
3. Come up with one other 2-sample proportion test using anything from the Star Wars dataset.
4. Test to see if income and response to "Which Character Shot First?" are Independent (Chi-square)


For the proportion tests:

1. Define the null and alternative hypotheses
2. Include an explanation and conclusion for hypothesis tests
3. Include Confidence intervals and a sentence explaining each
4. Check the requirements for the hypothesis test and the confidence intervals


For the Chi-square test:  

1. Define the null and alternative hypotheses
2. Include an explanation of the conclusion for 
3. Be sure to check the hypothesis requirements for a test of independence

# Data and Analysis

Load the data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(rio)
library(ggplot2)

sw <- import('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/master/Data/StarWarsData_clean.csv')

```


## Explore the data

```{r}

names(sw)

table(sw$`Favorability_Han Solo`)

addmargins(table(sw$`Favorability_Han Solo`, sw$Gender))

addmargins(table(sw$`Favorability_Emperor Palpatine`))

```



## One-sample Proportion Test

What proportion of respondents are very favorable towards Emperor Palpatine?

```{r}


```

Is this significantly less than 20%?

## Two-sample Proportion Test

What percent of female respondents are favorable towards Jar-Jar Binks?

What percent of male respondents are favorable towards Jar-Jar Binks?

```{r}

```

Are they significantly different?

## Choose your own adventure

Compare 2 proportions of your choosing and perform a `prop.test()`.


## Chi-square Test for Independence

Test to see if how you responded to the question "Who Shot First" is independent of income category.

```{r}

```

State your conclusion:
