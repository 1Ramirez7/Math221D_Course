# Instructions

Complete the following questions about testing differences between 2 proportions.  When completed, Render the `qmd` file and submit the `html`.

# A Penny Saved?

A random sample of BYU-Idaho students was surveyed and asked if they were in favor of retaining the penny as a form of currency in the United States. Out of the 116 women surveyed, 80 said that they were in favor of retaining the penny as a form of currency. Of the 137 men surveyed, 91 said that they were in favor of retaining the penny. For these questions, let group 1 represent women and group 2 represent men. 

__Question__:  Are the requirements satisfied for assuming normality?  Explain.  
__Answer__:  


Regardless of whether or not the requirements are satisfied, complete the following:

## Confidence Interval

Create a 95\% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of females to males who prefer to keep the penny:

```{r}

```

Interpret the confidence interval in context of the question:  


## Hypothesis Test

You also want to see if there is a difference between the proportion of women who want to keep the penny and the proportion of men who want to keep the penny. Use a level of significance of $\alpha = 0.05$.

State your null and alternative hypotheses:  

$$H_0: p_{female}???p_{male}$$  
$$H_a: p_{female}???p_{male}$$  

__Question__:  What is the test statistic?  
__Answer__:  


__Question__:  What is the P-value?  
__Answer__:  


Based on your decision rule, state your conclusion in context of the problem:  


## Couples Retreat?

A marriage counselor conducted a study of couples, categorizing each of the couples as "communicative" or "non-communicative". Among other things, the counselor wanted to see whether the percentage of communicative couples whose marriage ended in separation or divorce was the same as the percentage of non-communicative couples whose marriage ended in separation or divorce. 

Construct a null and alternative hypothesis for the study:

$$H_0: $$  
$$H_a: $$
