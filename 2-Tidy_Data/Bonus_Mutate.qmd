# Adding Columns

If we want to create a new column in our dataset, we use the tidy function, `mutate()`.  Consider again the High School survey data with 60 columns and 312 respondents.

```{r}
# Load libraries and data

library(rio)
library(mosaic)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)

survey <- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/HighSchoolSeniors_subset.csv') %>% tibble()
```

To create a new column, "pipe" the raw data into the `mutate()` statement. Inside the parentheses, give the new column a name and set it equal to what you want that column to be.  

__EXAMPLE__:  It is widely known that arm span is typically very close to one's height.  Let's create a column of the ratio of Height (`Height_cm`) to armspan (`Armspan_cm`) and call the new column, `ht_to_span`.  If common knowledge is correct, we would expect the ratio to be close to 1 on average.

```{r}

clean <- survey %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm)

mean(clean$ht_to_span)
```

Notice that the mean is `Inf` which means infinity, or undefined.  This is likely due to R attempting to divide a number by zero, meaning someone answered that their arm span was zero.  This is where [`filter()`](../2-Tidy_Data/02-Filter.qmd) comes in handy.  We can filter out the rows where Armspan_cm is 0:

```{r}
clean <- survey %>%
  filter(Armspan_cm > 0) %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm)

histogram(clean$ht_to_span, xlab = "Height / Armspan", main = "Distribution of Height to Armspan Ratio")

```

It's difficult to imagine someone who is 40 times taller than his or her arm span.  But this is sufficient to illustrate the `mutate()` function.

__EXAMPLE__:  Now let's make a new column that converts `Height_cm` into inches:

```{r}
clean <- survey %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm,
         Height_in = Height_cm / 2.54)

```

```{r}
clean <- survey %>%
  filter(Armspan_cm > 0) %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm,
         Height_in = Height_cm / 2.54) %>%
  select(Height_cm, Armspan_cm, ht_to_span, Height_in) %>% 
  filter(ht_to_span < 1.5,
         ht_to_span > .5)
clean

histogram(clean$ht_to_span, xlab = "Height / Armspan", main = "Distribution of Height to Armspan Ratio")

```

I decided on 1.5 and .5 as the filter values by trial and error.  There are better ways to determine outliers.  But I suspect it is rare indeed for someone to be 50% taller than their armspan or 50% shorter.
