# Introduction

In this assignment, you will practice regression analysis including:

  * Plotting bivariate data with a regression line
  * Calculating and interpreting the correlation coefficient, r
  * Fitting a linear regression analysis
  * Verifying if a linear model is model is adequate:
    * Checking for linearity (scatterplot)
    * Checking for constant variance (`plot(lm_output, which=1)`)
    * Checking for normality of residuals (`qqPlot(lm_output$residuals)`)

# Car Prices and Mileage

<p align="center">

</p>


You are interested in purchasing an all wheel drive Acura MDX for those slick Rexburg winters.  You found what you think is a good deal for on a low-mileage 2020 model but you'd like to be sure.  You go on Autotrader.com and randomly select 23 Acura MDX's and collect Price and Mileage information.

Load the data and use R to answer the questions below.  

```{r}

cars <- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/acuraMDX_price_vs_mileage.csv')

```

__QUESTION__:  What is the response/dependent variable?  
__ANSWER__:  


__QUESTION__:  What is the explanatory variable?  
__ANSWER__:  


__QUESTION__:  What do you think is the nature of the relationship between the two?  (Positive or Negative?)
__ANSWER__:  


__QUESTION__:  How strong do you think the relationship is?  
__ANSWER__:  



## Plot the Data and calculate r

Use `ggplot()` to create a scatter plot with the regression line, then calculate r:  

```{r}
# geom_smooth(method="lm")



```


__QUESTION__:  Does the relationship look linear?  
__ANSWER__:  


__QUESTION__:  What is the correlation coefficient, r?  
__ANSWER__:  


__QUESTION__:  What does r show?   
__ANSWER__:  


## Fit a Linear Regression Model

```{r}

#lm_output <- lm()

```


__QUESTION__:  What is the slope of the regression line, and what does it mean?  
__ANSWER__:  


__QUESTION__:  What is the intercept and what does it mean?  
__ANSWER__:  


__QUESTION__:  What is the p-value?  
__ANSWER__:  


__QUESTION__:  State your conclusion in context of the research question:  
__ANSWER__:  


__QUESTION__:  What is the confidence interval for the slope?  
__ANSWER__:  

```{r}

```

__QUESTION__:  Explain the confidence interval in context of the research question:  
__ANSWER__:  



## Check Model Requirements

Check the normality of the residuals:

```{r}

```

Check for constant variance (Residual by Predicted plot):

```{r}
#plot(lm_output, which = 1)
```


__QUESTION__:  Do the test requirements appear to be satisfied?  Why?  
__ANSWER__:  


## Good Price?  

Lastly, the car you're interested in buying has around 100,000 miles and costs $11,200.  Could this be considered a good deal?  Why?

```{r}

</p>

Florida is a fabulous place for experiencing wildlife and recreation.  Unfortunately, sometimes those two activities conflict.

Researchers collected over 30 years of data about water craft registrations (motor and non-motor boats) and manatee deaths.  The goal of the research is to evaluate the relationship between boat registrations and manatee deaths.

Load the data and use R to answer the questions below.  

```{r}
manatees <- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/manatees.csv')

The MCAT is an entrance exam for medical schools.  It seems likely that there is a relationship between your undergraduate GPA and how well you do on the MCAT.  

GPA and MCAT score data were collected on 55 prospective medical students.
