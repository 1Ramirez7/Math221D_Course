## A Customizable Textbook

This book is meant to be a starting point for you to learn design and analysis of experiments. You should feel free to edit the Rmarkdown files so that the book becomes your own.

### How to Use This Book

You can navigate the lessons using the "Lessons" drop down.  Each lesson will consist of background readings, example code, and an opportunity to practice.

Homework assignments can be viewed and downloaded from the "Homework" tab.  

Application Activities are designed to give you a more real-world experience dealing with data.  

The section labeld "R Help" provides resources to help with R programming.  


#### Suggested Sequence of Topics for Teaching

This book was specifically designed for the Math326 Design and Analysis of Experiments class at BYU-Idaho, as it stands in 2022. BYU-I follows a 14 week semester. After introducing some foundational principles of experimental design, the recommended sequence follows the general pattern of

-   Introduce a specific design: suitability/benefits of the design, explanation of the design, factor structure and decomposition, steps for analysis (including R code)
-   Discuss new topics/complexities/considerations associated with that design located in the Broad Topics list.

Here is a specific, suggested reading schedule:

  1. Course Introduction, including R installation
  2. Summarizing Data - Shape and Center
  3. Summarizing Data - Measures of Spread
  4. Probability
  5. Normal Distribution
  6. Distribution of Sample Means
  7. Probability Calculations for Means
  8. Introduction to Hypothesis Testing
  9. Introduction to Confidence Intervals
  10. Inference for a Mean
  11. Inference for Dependent Samples
  12. Intference for Independent Samples
  13. ANOVA
  14. Regression
  15. Distribution of $\hat{p}$
  16. Inference for 1 Proportion
  17. Inference for 2 Proportions
  18. Chi Square Test for Independence

## Book Scope

This is an introductory book intended to familiarize students with foundational concepts and vocabulary in statistics and introduce basic data wrangling and visualization in R. 

Those who dilligently work through these materials should be well prepared for their next statistics course whether in Psychology or Fish and Wildlife Management.
