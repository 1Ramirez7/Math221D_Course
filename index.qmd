## A Customizable Textbook

This course is intended to familiarize students with foundational concepts and vocabulary in statistics and introduce basic data wrangling and visualization in R.

Those who diligently work through these materials will be well prepared for their next Statistics or Data Science course.

This book is designed to be a digital workbook.  You can download the Workbooks, Practice Problems and Application Activities which can be edited locally on your computer.  Completed workbooks and assignments will be submitted in Canvas as web-page reports.  


### How to Use This Book

Each lesson will typically include:
  * Background readings (either from Stats Fundamentals or Workbooks)
  * Example code (mostly in Workbooks)
  * Opportunities to practice (Practice Problems and Application Activities)
  
Stats Fundamentals is a great reference for the core principles which are used throughout the course.  

Workbooks are more hands-on, interactive activities that reinforce and expand on the key topics from Stats Fundamentals.  

The Practice Problems tab provides opportunities to practice.  Sometimes these will be done in class with the assistance of teacher, TA, and friends.  Other times they will be completed on your own outside of class.  

Application Activities are designed to give you a more real-world experience dealing with data.  They are larger projects that may cover multiple lessons.

The section labeled "R Help" provides resources to help with R programming.
