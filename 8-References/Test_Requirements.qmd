# Hypothesis Test Requirements Overview

Understanding the assumptions and requirements for different statistical tests is crucial to ensure valid conclusions. Below is a summary of the key conditions that must be checked for common tests used in introductory statistics.

# One-Sample and Two-Sample Tests for Means

### One-sample t-test  

  1. Randomization  
      - Ensures independence of the observations  
  2. Normality of the mean:  
      - Large enough sample size (N>30)  
      - OR the population is normally distributed  
        - Check Q-Q plot of the sample; if the sample reflects the population and the sample is normal, we infer the population is normal  

### Two-sample t-test (independent samples)

Same as above, but for BOTH groups.  


### Two-sample t-test (dependent samples)

Same as above, but for the differences


# Tests for Proportions


## One-Sample z-test

**Requirements**:  

1. Randomization ensures observations are independent
2. Sample Size:  
    - Expected counts of successes and failures in each group should be at least 10:  

$$np \ge 10$$

$$n(1-p) \ge 10$$ where p is the hypothesized value for the population proportion


## Confidence Intervals
1. Observed number of yeses and nos are both greater than 10:  
$$n\hat{p} \ge 10$$
$$n(1-\hat{p}) \ge 10$$




## Two-Sample Proportions z-test

1. Observed number of yeses and nos are both greater than 10 for BOTH groups:  


$$n_1\hat{p_1} \ge 10$$
$$n_1(1-\hat{p_1}) \ge 10$$ 

AND

$$n_2\hat{p_2} \ge 10$$
$$n_2(1-\hat{p_2}) \ge 10$$

## Confidence Interval

Same for the Hypothesis Test for the Difference between the 2 proportions.  


# Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

**Requirements**:
1. __Randomization__ ensures observations are independent:  
2. Normality of residuals:
    - Check with Q-Q plots
3. Homogeneity of Variances:  
    - Variances in different groups should be approximately equal.
    - Check that the biggest group standard deviation is less than 2x the smallest (max(sds)/min(sds))


# 4. Regression Analysis

**Requirements**:

1. __Linearity__:  
    - The relationship between predictors and response should be linear.  
    - Check scatterplots.  
2. __Independence__:  
    - Observations should be independent.  
3. Normality of Residuals**:  
    - Residuals should be approximately normally distributed (check with histogram or Q-Q plot).
4. __Homoscedasticity__:
    - Variance of residuals should be constant across levels of predictors.
    - Check residual plots.


## 5. Chi-square Test of Independence

### **Test**:
- Chi-square test for independence in contingency tables

### **Requirements**:
1. __Sample Size__:
  - Expected cell counts should be at least 5 in each cell.
2. __Independence__:
  - Observations should be independent.
